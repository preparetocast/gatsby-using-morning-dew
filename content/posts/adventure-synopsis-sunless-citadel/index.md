The synopsis the module gives for itself is a bit different from [the one I gave](/the-sunless-citadel/#sunless-citadel-overview). Paraphrasing the module:

1. Oakhurst: The PCs may occasionally retreat to a nearby small town to recuperate and replenish supplies.
1. Kobolds: It's possible that diplomatic heroes can avoid strife with the kobolds and strike a bargain with them, but only if the heroes agree to retrieve a lost "pet" for the kobold leader.
1. Goblins: The adventurers have less luck dealing peacefully with the goblins, who feel confident of their strength and prove unwilling to negotiate.
1. The Hidden Grove and Environs: PCs learn the truth of the enchanted fruit. They also must confront and defeat Belak the Outcast and the Gulthias Tree if they hope to win free and feel the light of day again.

They didn't consider the wild animals worth mentioning, nor the setting of the ruined Citadel the module is named after, but it *does* point out that the players can retreat to the nearby town of Oakhurst. This really is a big deal that dramatically changes the rhythm of the adventure.

The distance between Oakhurst and the Sunless Citadel, via the Old Road, is seven miles. 140 minutes walking. (Unless there's deep snow, but while questing for the poisonous winter fruit might be interesting, practically everyone is going to assume the adventure starts in summer. It's much easier to build character motivations around a *healing* fruit.)

It's a *great* idea for a first-level module to put the town so close to the dungeon to encourage players to retreat, rest and restock when they're running out of steam. First-level characters are fragile, and you can easily get a total party wipe if they try to push onward.

Putting Oakhurst close enough to be easily reachable from the dungeon --- but far enough that it's still clearly separated from the Underworld --- encourages players to return to town to rest.
Assuming they don't dawdle, they can literally hike to the dungeon, do their adventuring, and hike back to town before nightfall, staying in town every night.

Meanwhile, The Forge of Fury places Blasingdell a full thirty miles from the Forge --- and that is also the right decision. In the second adventure, the training wheels are off. On the other hand, the Forge of Fury isn't harsh; "the characters can find any number of defensible campsites in the forest near the Stone Tooth. As long as the characters keep a vigilant watch, they should have no problems resting out side the dungeon." The Forge of Fury carefully breaks its antagonists into three distinct factions so that, whichever the PCs happen to be fighting at the moment, they'll probably have absolutely *mauled* that particular faction by the time they retreat, so that the bad guys won't be able to mount an effective pursuit.

But one thing is for sure: the goblins are a big part of this adventure. I'd even place the kobolds as practically a sub-bullet of the goblins, because interaction with the kobolds is driven primarily by having the goblins as a common enemy. (If the kobolds take any issue with players looting their sacred temple, the module doesn't mention it.)

And yet, the goblins weren't mentioned in the [Adventure Background](/sunless-citadel-adventure-background) at all.
The only thing the opening text crawl even potentially mentions is that the Oakhurstians have a bad attitude about treating peacefully with goblins. If anything, the text strongly implies this is due to pure racism on their part:

> Solving a Mystery: The goblin tribe infesting the nearby ruins (called the Sunless Citadel, though no one knows why) ransoms a single piece of magical fruit to the highest bidder in Oakhurst once every midsummer. They've been doing this for the last twelve years. Usually, the fruit sells for around 50 gp, which is all the townspeople can bring themselves to pay a goblin. They sometimes plant the seeds at the center of each fruit, hoping to engender an enchanted apple tree. When the seeds germinate in their proper season, they produce a twiggy mass of twisted sapling stems. Not too long after the saplings reach 2 feet in height, they are stolen every time. The townsfolk assume that the jealous goblins send out thieves to ensure their monopoly of enchanted fruit.
