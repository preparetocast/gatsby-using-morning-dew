The synopsis the module gives for itself is a bit different from [the one I gave](/the-sunless-citadel/#sunless-citadel-overview). Paraphrasing the module:

1. Oakhurst: The PCs may occasionally retreat to a nearby small town to recuperate and replenish supplies.
1. Kobolds: It's possible that diplomatic heroes can avoid strife with the kobolds and strike a bargain with them, but only if the heroes agree to retrieve a lost "pet" for the kobold leader.
1. Goblins: The adventurers have less luck dealing peacefully with the goblins, who feel confident of their strength and prove unwilling to negotiate.
1. The Hidden Grove and Environs: PCs learn the truth of the enchanted fruit. They also must confront and defeat Belak the Outcast and the Gulthias Tree if they hope to win free and feel the light of day again.

They didn't consider the wild animals worth mentioning, nor the setting of the ruined Citadel the module is named after, but it *does* point out that the players can retreat to the nearby town of Oakhurst. This really is a big deal that dramatically changes the rhythm of the adventure.

The distance between Oakhurst and the Sunless Citadel, via the Old Road, is seven miles. 140 minutes walking. (Unless there's deep snow, but while questing for the poisonous winter fruit might be interesting, practically everyone is going to assume the adventure starts in summer. It's much easier to build character motivations around a *healing* fruit.)

It's a *great* idea for a first-level module to put the town so close to the dungeon to encourage players to retreat, rest and restock when they're running out of steam. First-level characters are fragile, and you can easily get a total party wipe if they try to push onward.

Putting Oakhurst close enough to be easily reachable from the dungeon --- but far enough that it's still clearly separated from the Underworld --- encourages players to return to town to rest.
Assuming they don't dawdle, they can literally hike to the dungeon, do their adventuring, and hike back to town before nightfall, staying in town every night.

Meanwhile, The Forge of Fury places Blasingdell a full thirty miles from the Forge --- and that is also the right decision. In the second adventure, the training wheels are off. On the other hand, the Forge of Fury isn't harsh; "the characters can find any number of defensible campsites in the forest near the Stone Tooth. As long as the characters keep a vigilant watch, they should have no problems resting out side the dungeon." The Forge of Fury carefully breaks its antagonists into three distinct factions so that, whichever the PCs happen to be fighting at the moment, they'll probably have absolutely *mauled* that particular faction by the time they retreat, so that the bad guys won't be able to mount an effective pursuit.

But one thing is for sure: the goblins are a big part of this adventure. I'd even place the kobolds as practically a sub-bullet of the goblins, because interaction with the kobolds is driven primarily by having the goblins as a common enemy. (If the kobolds take any issue with players looting their sacred temple, the module doesn't mention it.)

And yet, the goblins weren't mentioned in the [Adventure Background](/sunless-citadel-adventure-background) at all.
The only thing the opening text crawl even potentially mentions is that the Oakhurstians have a bad attitude about treating peacefully with goblins. If anything, the text strongly implies this is due to pure racism on their part:

> Solving a Mystery: The goblin tribe infesting the nearby ruins (called the Sunless Citadel, though no one knows why) ransoms a single piece of magical fruit to the highest bidder in Oakhurst once every midsummer. They've been doing this for the last twelve years. Usually, the fruit sells for around 50 gp, which is all the townspeople can bring themselves to pay a goblin. They sometimes plant the seeds at the center of each fruit, hoping to engender an enchanted apple tree. When the seeds germinate in their proper season, they produce a twiggy mass of twisted sapling stems. Not too long after the saplings reach 2 feet in height, they are stolen every time. The townsfolk assume that the jealous goblins send out thieves to ensure their monopoly of enchanted fruit.
>
> --- <cite>The Sunless Citadel, page 3</cite>

Leaving aside the ethical questions raised by the goblins of the Monsanto tribe resorting to extreme measures to maintain their monopoly, this doesn't sound like the sort of legal dispute that is usually solved by, you know, *killing them all*. I mean, obviously that will resolve the situation. But it doesn't seem very...heroic...to jump to that as a first option. Nobody in Oakhurst even *asked* the players to massacre the Monsanto tribe. And are you even sure you can cultivate the fruit without the goblins' expertise? (It's actually Belak who grows the fruit, but nobody knows that; all anyone knows is that the goblins sell the fruit.) There's no mention of anyone besides the goblins ever being able to produce this wonder. Any goblin you kill might be the one who knows the secret.

The players have the *option* to spend 1d4+1 hours and "a few gold pieces for buying drinks and making friends" to learn more. But suppose, for the moment, that they don't. In that case, the next they hear about the goblins is from Meepo, a kobold. Players are discouraged from attacking Meepo by the fact that he's patently harmless: "The kobold is generally weepy and obviously physically frightened of the PCs."

> The wretched goblins stole Calcryx, our dragon!
>
> --- <cite>Meepo</cite>

That would be Calcryx, the kobolds' four-year-old prisoner-cum-attack-dog. Do the kobolds deliberately hide the truth about Calcryx? If so, the PCs should get a Sense Motive check. (Sense Motive represents all the little cues that you could see in person but which obviously don't come through when you're hearing about what the kobolds said secondhand through the DM.)

> The putrid goblins stole our dragon! If you return the dragon to us, I shall grant you a reward.
>
> --- <cite>Yusdrayl</cite>

Also, the goblins were here first. The kobolds "recently challenged the goblins' ownership of the fortress" and started killing goblins left and right out of religious fanaticism. The kobolds don't mention that either, and again, no Sense Motive roll. It really doesn't seem like the kobolds are trying to *hide* anything from the PCs. Indeed it seems more as if the kobolds would be completely upfront about all this if the PCs bothered to ask. But the writer doesn't contemplate the possibility that the PCs might bother to ask. This is hard to pin down, but...it really seems like the adventure just *assumes* the PCs have come to kill goblins, and the only question is whether they make an alliance of convenience with the kobolds.

Why? Sure, [goblins are evil in this world, but kobolds are just as evil](/the-theaetetus). And the module certainly doesn't assume the PCs will want to wipe out the kobolds for no other reason than wiping out kobolds.

This is an introductory adventure. New players (who might be more familiar with different fantasy worlds) might not automatically associate "goblin" with "kill them all." ("Goblins? Like the guys who run Gringotts, right?")

The Sunless Citadel wears two hats: it's an introduction to Dungeons & Dragons for new players, but it's also an introduction to Third Edition for old-school 2e players. I think what we're seeing here is the latter hat taking over. If we look at this through the lens of old-timey dungeon-crawling, it makes a lot more sense. Meepo's design and presentation are simple and brilliant: the writer really put themselves into the shoes of the hack-n-slashers and foresaw that they'd immediately attack if they first met a fortified kobold gate (as would really make more sense in an active war zone). They knew what the usual response to kobolds would be, and they planned a way around it.

But that comes back to bite the writer with the goblins. They're stuck in that mode of thinking that players will slaughter everyone by default and need a reason *not* to kill.

I don't mean that the players *won't* fight the goblins. Obviously in actual play, they do. In fact, they don't have a choice:

> This room serves as a guard post for the goblins of the Durbuluk tribe. This tribe defends itself mostly against possible intrusions by the recent kobold invaders, though they're also wary about the remote possibility of intruders coming by way of the Old Road. Two goblins are stationed here, and if alerted by the bell alarm in adjoining area 31 (or by loud PCs moving through the caltrop hallway), they chuck javelins at the PCs under cover of the half-wall. Diplomacy is not an option with these goblins. If captured and somehow forced to answer questions, these goblins know the same information as is listed for Erky Timbers located in the goblin stockade (see area 34), though they answer more crudely.
>
> --- <cite>The Sunless Citadel, page 18</cite>

They know what Erky Timbers knows, but the module does not equip the goblins with an answer to what seems like the most pertinent question, namely "WHY DID YOU TRY TO KILL US?! WHAT IS YOUR PROBLEM?!"

When somebody rings *my* doorbell, I don't chuck lethal weapons at them, even if I wasn't expecting them. These are theoretically the same tribe who peacefully visit Oakhurst twice a year to hold an auction. And an auction is coming up soon. The players could be forgiven for immediately ducking back through the doorway and shouting "AAAAHHH! STOP! WHY ARE YOU ATTACKING US?!"

They *won't*, of course. Players are generally pretty easygoing about these things. If creatures are attacking them for no reason, they'll generally transition straight into war mode without questioning it.

But...I claim that it nevertheless makes the adventure less engaging, in not-immediately-obvious ways. The players are still playing a game, but they're not playing a role.
They can try, but the module doesn't really provide anything to support it.

Suppose that, instead of charging the fortified goblin gate, the players duck back out of the goblin's line of fire and shout for parley. How do the goblins react? There *are* no roleplaying notes on the goblins. Why are the goblins attacking? What do they want?

Sure, the goblins have "recently" been attacked and are currently under siege...but they're under siege by kobolds, not humans. If humans have shown up, that means they must have broken through the kobold blockade. From the goblins' perspective, isn't that a *good* thing?

Of course, there is more to this story. It's just that for some reason it's gated behind a willingness to spend 1d4+1 hours in a bar trolling for rumors.

> The Old Road ran right past the nearby ruins (the Sunless Citadel), but fell into disuse because of goblin banditry. No one knows for sure what the Sunless Citadel once was, but old legends hint that it served as the retreat of an ancient dragon cult.
> The Old Road also skirts the Ashen Plain, a lifeless...
>
> --- <cite>The Sunless Citadel, page 3</cite>

Wait wait wait, back up a step. What was that bit right before you started talking about dragon cults? You don't use the road anymore because of goblin banditry? The same goblins who you currently buy fruit from? Seems like you're burying the lede, right there.

(The text doesn't even clarify in the Oakhurst section that these really were the same goblins rather than different goblins, though that is clarified in the notes on interrogating the goblins themselves.)

That revelation puts the conflict between the Durbuluks and the Oakhurstians into a *very* different light. The Durbuluks have been operating as robber barons...until finally trade dropped off *completely*, presumably devastating the Oakhurst economy. Oakhurst has ample reason to want war. If the Durbuluks were gone, Oakhurst would be a crossroads again. And thus, the goblins have ample reason to immediately attack any humans showing up on their doorstep --- both because they have reason to expect the Oakhurstians to be hostile, and because that's just what they've always done.

This really seems like it should be opening-text-crawl information, here. It provides *critically important* context to both of the designated character hooks. The reason for the townspeople's attitude towards the Durbuluk tribe is that, prior to the goblins' side-business in miracles, they were thugs, thieves, and murderers who brought the trade through this *former* crossroads to its knees.

It's finally time to talk about character hooks.
