The first thing the module tells you about the adventure is the history. That's not nearly as bad as it sounds.

> Unsurprisingly, there's a complex lore and backstory behind this state of affairs, and I admit that this is where I would normally check out; this sort of thing is so commonly tiresome in fantasy. An author creates a convoluted narrative of gods and wars and legends and thinks the reader will find it as interesting as they do, if only they relay every detail precisely. The result is a plodding, ponderous shaggy dog myth that competes for headspace with the dozen other lores the player had to memorize. What these fantasy authors fail to realize is that history is not story. It's the tools for telling a story.

> How did the self-made gods come into being? Great question! I don't know. All I or anybody else knows is that there's a half-dozen different accounts all believed passionately by factions that bring their own prejudices and needs and grudges onboard. The history of the tribunal's divinity resembles a real history: a he-said she-said conflict of mythologies and folk accounts that sparks heated arguments and debate even between people on the same side. History as a debate is much more interesting to learn and follow than history as an inventory, and conflict over who is right is more interesting that conflict over who is stronger.

The most notable thing about the Adventure Background is what isn't there: any explanation of the Citadel itself. All we know is that it's a citadel and somehow it got put underground, presumably by powerful magic, which is more the sort of thing that the locals can figure out just by looking at the place than "history" per se.

All of the current inhabitants showed up long after the Citadel fell into disrepair. Later we'll meet a kobold cult who believe themselves to be the inheritors of this place. Are they right? Maybe! The one thing we can figure out pretty quickly is that they don't have any really solid information on the Citadel either.

Instead the Adventure Background covers just two elements: the Gulthias Tree, and Belak the Outcast.

> ...the Gulthias Tree, which sprouted from a wooden stake used to slay an ancient vampire.
>
> Upon the Gulthias Tree, magical fruit extrudes forth: A single perfect ruby-red apple ripens at the summer solstice, and a single albino apple ripens at the winter solstice. The midsummer fruit grants vigor, health, and life, while the midwinter fruit steals the same. But the seed of either fruit, if allowed to sprout, brings forth only ill: Vaguely humanoid and evilly animated stick bundles known as twig blights eventually spring forth.
>
> --- <cite>The Sunless Citadel, page 2</cite>

The fruit is the central quasi-mystery of the adventure. The fact that such fruit exists is common knowledge; it's part of the opening text crawl. If you do character hooks right, the players will learn about the fruit literally before they create their characters. The conceit of magical healing fruit can be easily worked into the motivation of many different kinds of characters, so it works out well for PCs to come seeking the fruit for one reason or another. Of course, as the adventure progresses, they'll eventually learn the Dark Secret.

Strangely, the Adventure Background doesn't mention the really important Dark Secret, which is that the tree dominates the mind of anyone bound to it long enough. The twig blights are fairly generic, and the module treats them as such, whereas the "supplicants" of the Gulthias Tree are rightly treated as a major revelation.

As for Belak the Outcast, he came seeking the fruit, too.

> Belak was drawn to the buried citadel twelve years ago, following stories of oddly enchanted fruit to their source…at the old fortress's core, Belak the Outcast stumbled upon the Twilight Grove. He discovered at the grove's heart the Gulthias Tree.
>
> --- <cite>The Sunless Citadel, page 2</cite>

That is definitely *not* common knowledge, but it's a good idea to hint to players that creating characters with some interest in or connection to druids and/or nature would be a plus.
Of course, the PCs don't know about Belak and his Evil Plan.

> The PCs are not initially privy to the background information, but they may learn it during the adventure.
>
> --- <cite>The Sunless Citadel, page 2</cite>

You *may* perhaps have noticed the big, fat "may" squatting in that sentence.

We should talk about Belak now, because this is the last we'll see or hear of him for a long, long time.

> It's not easy being a villain in a game. It's all right if you're on a stage or in a film - lots of opportunities for mustache-twirling and monologuing.

> However, in a game, you've got to contend with the fact that most players are scarily sociopathic loons who'd quite happily murder anyone who even looks as though they might possibly get in the vicinity of their way in the near or long-term future.

> Basically, it's impossible to have the villain and the hero meet before the final confrontation because most people's reaction will be "I stab him with my sword until he dies." Rule of law? I am the law!
>
> Just look at Garius: he's about to exit the story and we barely know him! We've never even spoken two words to him! In the above dialogue, he's not even talking directly to us!
> We don't know a lot about Garius, and what we do know is mostly inferred from subtext and such. I mean, we know what Wizards in black robes with no hair are like - mean, cruel, crazed-with-power. And look at Lorne and Torio: as their superior, Garius must therefore be smarter than Torio, stronger than Lorne. It's implicit.
>
> But it's not good enough. We've learned that Garius is interested in the silver shards - but why? He's the third person to be involved, and although we know why Zeeaire wanted the shards, and although we- I know why the Warlock wants the shards, what exactly is Garius going to do with them? What can he do with them?
>
> --- <cite>[Lieutenant Danger](https://lparchive.org/Neverwinter-Nights-2/Update%2050/)</cite>

There are ways to deal with this problem. You introduce the villain indirectly. You hear about his deeds secondhand. You show other people's reactions to him.
In fact, the game Lieutenant Danger is talking about does some of this (though not enough).

> Torio Claven: If he has the power of a seer, then let us test it. Marcus, what do I hold in my left hand?
>
> Marcus: Your left hand holds the ring of Garius, the Master of the Fifth Tower. You hold it tightly, as if afraid it will fly from you. Every time you touch the ring, you see how angry he becomes when one fails him, and you fear his ambition… it is a ring that is more of a chain than a piece of jewelry. And even more so, the ring reminds you of…

Does The Sunless Citadel do anything to introduce the villain like that? Well...it's complicated. The players can hear about Belak if they specifically ask. But only if they ask. And the only thing they learn is that the goblins work for Belak and that [Our Princess Is In Another Castle](https://knowyourmeme.com/memes/but-our-princess-is-in-another-castle).

In town, before entering the Citadel

> Garon, the barkeep of the Ol' Boar Inn, remembers the last time anyone, aside from Talgen and Sharwyn, asked questions about the Sunless Citadel. About thirteen years ago, a grim man named Belak stopped by, and he had a very large pet tree frog.
>
> --- <cite>The Sunless Citadel, page 4</cite>

> The Outcast, he lives below. He grows the fruit, which he gives to the goblins. The thieving goblins are his servants!
>
> --- <cite>Yusdrayl</cite>

> I've heard the goblins talk about the Twilight Grove down below. There an evil druid called Belak tends an enchanted garden and harvests the enchanted fruit from something the goblins call the Gulthias Tree, but only in the most terrified of whispers. The enchanted fruit grows on the Gulthias Tree.
>
> The midsummer fruit restores spirit and vigor to those who eat it; the pale midwinter fruit steals the same. Belak allows the goblins to sell the fruit on the surface, but I don't know why.
>
> ...Talgen, Sharwyn, and Sir Braford. The goblins kept them in here only about a week. Belak wanted them, and that's the last I've heard about that.
>
> --- <cite>Erky Timbers</cite>

It's a little peculiar that the module never details how captured goblins themselves talk about Belak, even though they "know the same information as Erky Timbers" since obviously they are the source of everything Erky Timbers knows, and presumably Yusdrayl learned everything she knows from interrogating her own goblin prisoners.

The players certainly won't see Belak in person, because:

> Belak rarely stirs from area 56.
>
> --- <cite>The Sunless Citadel, page 23</cite>

56 is a high number. In fact, it's basically impossible to meet Belak without clearing pretty much the entire dungeon first.

So the players only get a sense of who Belak is two minutes before killing him? Well...not quite.

> In order to answer those questions about my personality, you have two options. The first is to meet with me twice a week for a year --- to have lunch or dinner or go to a movie with me --- to the point where you become one of my closest friends. The second option is to drop by my house when I'm not there and spend half an hour or so looking around.
>
> Samuel Gosling says, for example, that a person's bedroom gives three kinds of clues to his or her personality. There are, first of all, identity claims, which are deliberate expressions about how we would like to be seen by the world: a framed copy of a magna cum laude degree from Harvard, for example. Then there is behavioral residue, which is defined as the inadvertent clues we leave behind: dirty laundry on the floor, for instance, or an alphabetized CD collection. Finally, there are thoughts and feelings regulators, which are changes we make to our most personal spaces to affect the way we feel when we inhabit them: a scented candle in the corner, for example, or a pile of artfully placed decorative pillows on the bed. If you see alphabetized CDs, a Harvard diploma on the wall, incense on a side table, and laundry neatly stacked in a hamper, you know certain aspects about that individual's personality instantly, in a way that you may not be able to grasp if all you ever do is spend time with him or her directly.

The players don't see *Belak*, but they see *the dungeon*. On the upper level, they see the ruined majesty of a lost age, as well as how the goblins and kobolds have crudely adapted it for their purposes. On the lower level, Belak is the one who's left his mark on the area.

> Two rows of dragon-carved marble columns march the length of the hall, though most are completely smothered in luminescent fungus. The cobbled floor is cracked and stained with much use, and it holds many small wooden tables. Table contents include mortars and pestles, bowls filled with crushed leaves, chopped fungus stalks, and other plant specimens. The many doors leading off this hall are all partly open, and sounds are audible from beyond them.
>
> ...The small tables contain mashed leaves, fungus of a variety of types, bark, and powdered roots. A PC who makes a successful Knowledge (nature) check (DC 13) identifies many common varieties of tree, shrub, and fungus, although all have a pronounced pallor, as if sun-starved.
>
> 47b: A crude mashing, straining, and cask facility. Two goblins currently stand barefoot in the mashing-tun, squashing potatolike roots into pulp. A dirty straining bin stands nearby, as well as ten 2-gallon casks of the end product.
>
> 47d: Two goblins monitor the health of a dire rat, which is strapped spread-eagled onto a wooden bench. The dire rat suffers from horrible tumors that look vaguely woody and fruitlike. Without aid, the dire rat expires within the week. Its tumors stem from an elixir...in the corner on a stand in a fancy crystal vial. Treat the elixir as a disease if ingested (Fort save resists (DC 15), incubation 1 day; initial 1d4 Con damage, secondary 1d4 Con damage).

> --- <cite>The Sunless Citadel, page 24</cite>

> A layer of soil covers the floor. Rough wooden shelves, filled with a scattering of tomes and scrolls, line the north and east walls, while a rough-hewn desk stands in the center of the chamber. Fungus on the ceiling provides light, apparently in sufficient quantity to nourish several small bushes and pale saplings that grow in the soil.
>
> Most of the written material contains seasonal records of growth, precipitation, harvests, and similarly less than useful records for the surrounding upper lands for the last dozen years...and a tome written in Druidic worth 150 gp. A character fluent in Druidic can add +1 to all Knowledge checks dealing with nature.

So he's a book nerd? Not in general, no:

> Leaning and completely fallen stone bookshelves fill this chamber, though a clear path connects wooden doors on opposite walls. The litter of torn and burnt pages, bindings, and scrolls form disordered piles in the corners.
>
> Time and the occasional goblin visitor weren't too kind to this repository of draconic knowledge. Belak cared little for what may have survived, and so the room remains as he found it.

By now you may perhaps be spotting a pattern.

Yusdrayl knew (somehow) to call him the Outcast, but didn't specify *who* cast him out or *why*. By the time they've gotten through his Laboratory of Horrors, the players probably have a pretty good idea as to *why*, and while they'll technically have to talk to Belak in person to learn *who*, they already know everything important about what he's going to say: the people who cast him out were "THOSE FOOLS!!"

Why do Belak and the Gulthias Tree get detailed before anything else? Because the [resolution](https://theangrygm.com/lets-start-at-the-very-end/) of the adventure is going to center around the Tree and the Outcast.
One way or another, the story isn't done until the players have settled up with the tree and its shepherd.

*But* the tree and its shepherd are *not* given center stage immediately; they're introduced gradually, as the players are drip-fed information. For more than half the adventure, the main antagonists are the Durbuluk tribe and their brutal warlord Durnn, and at this point the attentive reader could be forgiven for asking "Who?"
