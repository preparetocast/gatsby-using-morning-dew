Kerowyn Hucrele, the mother of two of them, offers a reward for the safe return of her children, which happens to be 250 gp times the number of characters in the party, per child.
Kerowyn Hucrele offers half the reward for just their signet rings.

It's interesting that here the module explicitly bends reality according to the players, something it rarely does. If you only have two players, the reward is 500 gp per child; if you have six players, the reward is 1,500gp per child.

The treasure in the dungeon itself is *not* scaled to the number of players, so Kerowyn Hucrele's reward will be relatively trivial for two players, but very significant for six players. I don't really know what the thought process was here.
