Kerowyn Hucrele, the mother of two of them, offers a reward for the safe return of her children, which happens to be 250 gp times the number of characters in the party, per child.
Kerowyn Hucrele offers half the reward for just their signet rings.

It's interesting that here the module explicitly bends reality according to the players, something it rarely does. If you only have two players, the reward is 500 gp per child; if you have six players, the reward is 1,500gp per child.

The treasure in the dungeon itself is *not* scaled to the number of players, so Kerowyn Hucrele's reward will be relatively trivial for two players, but very significant for six players. I don't really know what the thought process was here.

It's also not entirely clear whether this was supposed to be an [Excuse Plot] or an invitation to investigate.
Was it supposed to be a mystery what happened to the adventurers?

The Oakhurstians know that the Durbuluks live in the Citadel, right? I mean, why wouldn't they?
As [we talked about before](/sunless-citadel-adventure-synopsis#durbuluks-raided-road), the goblins have had a big impact on Oakhurst.

For the Oakhurstians to not know the goblins are in the Citadel requires three consecutive unexplained contrivances:

1. The goblins carried on their entire campaign of banditry without anyone finding out where they were sallying forth from, BUT:
1. The previous party of adventurers found out their location after the fact, BUT:
1. They didn't bother to tell anyone else before they left.

None of these is impossible to justify, but you'd need a good explanation.

So the Oakhurstians know that the adventurers marched straight into the Durbuluk stronghold. And capturing humans for ransom isn't unusual behavior for the Durbuluks.

> The goblins in each [Area 36] are all 90% likely to inflict subdual damage with their saps when encountered by the PCs.
> If the goblins can render one or more PCs unconscious with subdual damage, they'll transfer them to the goblin stockade, locking victims into manacles there. At the same time, they'll take the captured equipment and deliver it to the goblin chief in area 41.
>
> If PCs cannot free themselves, the goblins eventually ransom lucky heroes back to concerned citizens in Oakhurst, though with no equipment or funds.

This makes perfect sense. The goblins trade peacefully with humans when there's profit in it for them, but they also won't hesitate to beat and rob anyone foolish enough to wander into their territory, and ransom them back to other humans for an additional profit.

![Mysteries](./mysteries.png)

A couple of young idiots suffering from affluenza wandered into the known territory of known kidnappers and haven't been seen since. What could *possibly* have happened to them?

And in this case, the obvious explanation is in fact correct: the Hucreles *were* captured by goblins. It's not at all clear from the text whether the Oakhurstians know this or will say so if the PCs bother to ask. I can't immediately think of a reason why they *wouldn't* know, nor why they wouldn't say. Indeed, it seems like Kerowyn Hucrele's original job ad ought to be pretty explicit that she's looking to hire goblin slayers. Or hostage negotiators.

The real mystery is why the goblins *haven't*, in the entire *month* since the Hucreles disappeared, made any ransom demands...and of course the most obvious explanation for *that* is that the adventurers were killed, not captured. As a general rule, if someone went into a dark hole a month ago and hasn't been seen since, that person is *dead*. Which raises a question: are the players supposed to anticipate that this is a shaggy-dog quest?

In the horror genre, if the protagonist gets a mission to rescue some people who went into Terrorville, you already pretty much expect that the heroes won't be able to rescue any of the missing people (except *maybe* one Final Girl) and that the best they can hope for is to escape the same fate. You further expect that the viewpoint characters are going to come face to face with the gruesome fates that befell the original party...one...by...one. And that's what happens in the Sunless Citadel.

And make no mistake, we *want* the players to more-or-less suspect this quest is doomed. Not the characters, but the players. This outcome need not be a huge letdown, *provided* you can foreshadow that this is the inevitable result.
