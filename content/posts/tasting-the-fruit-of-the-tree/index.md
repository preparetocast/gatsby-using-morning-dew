It's a bit odd that the rescue mission is the *first* character hook given, because if [that](/sunless-citadel-character-hooks-rescue-mission) is the first thing you hand to a player, it sounds like there's a mystery surrounding *why* the Hucreles went into the Citadel. In fact, while this is weird behavior for the scions of a wealthy merchant house, there are some fairly obvious explanations. But the text never really spells out any particular explanation --- so if the players go in seeing it as a mystery, they'll be disappointed when they never find an answer.

So the rescue mission doesn't stand on its own as a character hook. Rather, it must be combined with something else that serves as a character hook and doubles as an explanation for why the previous adventurers went in. That way, the rescue mission also serves to repeat and emphasize the other character hook.

What for the other character hook, then?

One obvious answer is simple goblin-slaying. [I criticized the module before](/sunless-citadel-adventure-synopsis) for not building up the goblins as villains. And if we fix that, then defeating the Durbuluks starts to sound like a decent goal on its own. But here, the module has the right idea *not* putting the goblins front-and-center. The [resolution](/sunless-citadel-adventure-background) isn't going to involve the Durbuluks at all; by the end, they'll have been supplanted. Indeed, by the midpoint of the adventure, the Durbuluks will be shattered and their warlord will be dead. We need to look at the *end* of the adventure and start to foreshadow that...even if the characters don't yet know that Belak exists.

We need to introduce the Gulthias tree...without actually seeing it. And this is where we get the payoff for the contrivance of a vampire tree somehow having healing powers.

The Sunless Citadel has a *fantastic* hook in the form of magical healing fruit:

> Solving a Mystery: The goblin tribe infesting the nearby ruins ransoms a single piece of magical fruit to the highest bidder in Oakhurst once every midsummer. They've been doing this for the last twelve years. Usually, the fruit sells for around 50 gp, which is all the townspeople can bring themselves to pay a goblin. They sometimes plant the seeds at the center of each fruit, hoping to engender an enchanted apple tree. When the seeds germinate in their proper season, they produce a twiggy mass of twisted sapling stems. Not too long after the saplings reach 2 feet in height, they are stolen every time. The townsfolk assume that the jealous goblins send out thieves to ensure their monopoly of enchanted fruit.

If you listened to [all my harping before](/sunless-citadel-adventure-synopsis), you might already be thinking unprompted that the townsfolk really don't look good if this is what you hand to players as their introduction to the adventure.

Not only does the hook make no mention of the goblins being raiders, it strongly implies the opposite: for the townsfolk to believe the goblins are stealing the saplings, they have to believe the goblins are able to get into the middle of town and make off with a small tree the size of a full-grown goblin. And yet, the goblins apparently haven't taken anything *else*, content to enforce their copyrights and leave. And nobody says anything along the lines of "I wonder why they didn't take anything else, though...?"

It's not unreasonable that Oakhurst doesn't have a palisade or anything --- defensive emplacements are expensive, and even if there were a wall, lack of lighting at night would allow goblins to stealthily go over the wall. So Oakhurst might reasonably be left vulnerable. But Oakhurst doesn't feel vulnerable to PCs in it. (And shouldn't; the reason Oakhurst is so close to the dungeon is to encourage PCs to return there to sleep.) Which makes it seem like the goblins just aren't a danger to humans, that they don't wage raiding campaigns.

Put yourself into the mindset of a new player, someone who's never fought goblins before. Assume that these players <em>didn't</em> spend 1d4+1 hours and "a few gold pieces" trolling for rumors in the bar.

Let's review here: goblins have been visiting Oakhurst at regular intervals, dispensing healing at way below market rates. The townspeople responded by sending a quartet of goons to break into the goblins' place. When the goons didn't come back, the townspeople responded to *that* by hiring a second set of goons.

You might be forgiven for having doubts at this point as to whether the townsfolk are really the people you should be siding with, here.

[Letting players know about the goblins' predations](/sunless-citadel-adventure-synopsis#durbuluks-raided-road) helps with *that* problem. But we're still left with the question: if the goblins can raid Oakhurst whenever they want, why *don't* they? It's hard to ignore this question when the starting character hook draws attention to it.

We can't give Oakhurst walls, because what's actually happening is that the saplings are walking away on their own, and a wall would stop that. (Unless we give the twig blights the ability to climb walls. *Vampires* have the ability to climb walls. Food for thought.)
