It's a bit odd that the rescue mission is the *first* character hook given, because if [that](/sunless-citadel-character-hooks-rescue-mission) is the first thing you hand to a player, it sounds like there's a mystery surrounding *why* the Hucreles went into the Citadel. In fact, while this is weird behavior for the scions of a wealthy merchant house, there are some fairly obvious explanations. But the text never really spells out any particular explanation --- so if the players go in seeing it as a mystery, they'll be disappointed when they never find an answer.

So the rescue mission doesn't stand on its own as a character hook. Rather, it must be combined with something else that serves as a character hook and doubles as an explanation for why the previous adventurers went in. That way, the rescue mission also serves to repeat and emphasize the other character hook.

What for the other character hook, then?

<a id="simple-goblin-slaying-possible-motivation"></a> One obvious answer is simple goblin-slaying. [I criticized the module before](/sunless-citadel-adventure-synopsis) for not building up the goblins as villains. And if we fix that, then defeating the Durbuluks starts to sound like a decent goal on its own. But here, the module has the right idea *not* putting the goblins front-and-center. The [resolution](/sunless-citadel-adventure-background) isn't going to involve the Durbuluks at all; by the end, they'll have been supplanted. Indeed, by the midpoint of the adventure, the Durbuluks will be shattered and their warlord will be dead. We need to look at the *end* of the adventure and start to foreshadow that...even if the characters don't yet know that Belak exists.

We need to introduce the Gulthias tree...without actually seeing it. And this is where we get the payoff for the contrivance of a vampire tree somehow having healing powers.

The Sunless Citadel has a *fantastic* hook in the form of magical healing fruit:

> Solving a Mystery: The goblin tribe infesting the nearby ruins ransoms a single piece of magical fruit to the highest bidder in Oakhurst once every midsummer. They've been doing this for the last twelve years. Usually, the fruit sells for around 50 gp, which is all the townspeople can bring themselves to pay a goblin. They sometimes plant the seeds at the center of each fruit, hoping to engender an enchanted apple tree. When the seeds germinate in their proper season, they produce a twiggy mass of twisted sapling stems. Not too long after the saplings reach 2 feet in height, they are stolen every time. The townsfolk assume that the jealous goblins send out thieves to ensure their monopoly of enchanted fruit.

If you listened to [all my harping before](/sunless-citadel-adventure-synopsis), you might already be thinking unprompted that the townsfolk really don't look good if this is what you hand to players as their introduction to the adventure.

Not only does the hook make no mention of the goblins being raiders, it strongly implies the opposite: for the townsfolk to believe the goblins are stealing the saplings, they have to believe the goblins are able to get into the middle of town and make off with a small tree the size of a full-grown goblin. And yet, the goblins apparently haven't taken anything *else*, content to enforce their copyrights and leave. And nobody says anything along the lines of "I wonder why they didn't take anything else, though...?"

It's not unreasonable that Oakhurst doesn't have a palisade or anything --- defensive emplacements are expensive, and even if there were a wall, lack of lighting at night would allow goblins to stealthily go over the wall. So Oakhurst might reasonably be left vulnerable. But Oakhurst doesn't feel vulnerable to PCs in it. (And shouldn't; the reason Oakhurst is so close to the dungeon is to encourage PCs to return there to sleep.) Which makes it seem like the goblins just aren't a danger to humans, that they don't wage raiding campaigns.

Put yourself into the mindset of a new player, someone who's never fought goblins before. Assume that these players <em>didn't</em> spend 1d4+1 hours and "a few gold pieces" trolling for rumors in the bar.

Let's review here: goblins have been visiting Oakhurst at regular intervals, dispensing healing at way below market rates. The townspeople responded by sending a quartet of goons to break into the goblins' place. When the goons didn't come back, the townspeople responded to *that* by hiring a second set of goons.

You might be forgiven for having doubts at this point as to whether the townsfolk are really the people you should be siding with, here.

[Letting players know about the goblins' predations](/sunless-citadel-adventure-synopsis#durbuluks-raided-road) helps with *that* problem. But we're still left with the question: if the goblins can raid Oakhurst whenever they want, why *don't* they? It's hard to ignore this question when the starting character hook draws attention to it.

We can't give Oakhurst walls, because what's actually happening is that the saplings are walking away on their own, and a wall would stop that.
(Unless we give the twig blights the ability to climb walls. *Vampires* have the ability to climb walls. Food for thought.)

There could be a standoff between the Oakhurstians and the Durbuluks --- raiding commerce wasn't enough to overcome the Oakhurstians' natural cowardice, but if the Durbuluks attacked them directly, they'd come together and make war. The Oakhurstians do outnumber the Durbuluks nine to one, and the Durbuluks do live in a ravine. Numbers don't do much good in a dungeon, but the Oakhurstians could probably set up an unassailable position atop the cliff and starve the goblins out.

Another option, which doesn't solve the problem but does make it less noticeable, is to emphasize that people plant the seeds out in the wilderness in hidden locations, and what the townsfolk wonder is how the goblins are able to *find* the saplings to steal them every time.

I don't have a great solution here. In any case, there's still the matter of the PCs' actual interest in the fruit. Why do *they* care?

> You are interested in piercing the mystery associated with how wretched goblins could ever possess such a wonder, and how they steal every sprouting sapling grown from the enchanted fruit's seed. Moreover, you wish to find this rumored tree of healing, hoping to heal an ailing friend or relative.
>
> --- <cite>The Sunless Citadel, page 3</cite>

That first bit seems like a poor choice for a hook, given that if a player does bother to ask how wretched goblins could ever possess such a wonder, the only answer they will ever find is "the goblins moved into a dungeon and it happened to be there."

The healing as a character goal, however, is fantastic. Because it's very versatile, but at the same time, the conceit of exactly one fruit per year means that you're not introducing a disruptive fountain of healing into the campaign world.

BUT. We also want to foreshadow the Dark Secret of the healing, preferably *immediately*, in the hook itself.

Just as we want the players to have some idea that they won't actually be able to rescue Talgen and Sharwyn, we want the players to have some idea that there's something wrong with this fruit. Otherwise, the climax will fail to land. ("It's an evil vampire tree? Wut?")

Fortunately, we ought to be able to use genre conventions to plant the idea in the players' minds that the miracle fruit will inevitably turn out to have a Dark Secret.

But we'll get into the foreshadowing more when we get to the rumors heard in [Ye Olde Fantasie Taverne](https://allthetropes.fandom.com/wiki/Ye_Olde_Butcherede_Englishe). (I will say now that I don't think the saplings disappearing, as mentioned in this hook, is enough foreshadowing on its own. The poisonous winter apples are no-shows in the hook, which seems like a questionable decision.)
Right now we're talking about hooking characters, and the big advantage an introductory adventure has is that you can create characters specifically to fit the hooks.

Pretty much any character concept has room for "an ailing friend or relative", but one thing you can *only* do when creating a character for this adventure is to give the PC an ailment to be cured --- something *noticeable* that will come up in the course of the adventure, but that isn't crippling enough to prevent them from successfully completing the adventure.

Obviously not all players will want an ailment, but if one does, it's good to have a list of ailments that the apple can heal. In-universe, of course, the character doesn't know for sure exactly what the apple can heal...but imagine what an anticlimax it would be if it turned out the apple couldn't heal them. So out-of-universe, whatever is wrong with them, the apple is in fact going to heal it.

The module does specify exactly what the apple does: it duplicates the effect of the Heal spell [Sunless Citadel page 28]. Thus, the rules effectively give us a list of suggested ailments that could be used as motivation.

It's not a short list. After years of writers of various books dreaming up horrible conditions that can afflict characters and defaulting to Heal as a catch-all "if you don't know what cures it, it's probably Heal", there's a variety to choose from. Many are too crippling for a player character to plausibly go on an adventure with, but a few are suitable for adventuring:

- Memory loss due to pixie arrows [Monster Manual page 236]
- Severe phobias [Heroes of Horror page 62]
- The insanity caused by an obyrith's form of madness [Fiendish Codex I page 28]
- The permanent fear caused by hearing many souls cry out in terror and be suddenly silenced [[Random Encounters, "Nasty Surprises"](http://archive.wizards.com/default.asp?x=dnd/re/20040216a)]
- Transformation by aboleth slime [Monster Manual page 8]
- Interrupted transformation into an ophidian [Fiend Folio page 134]

Others are suitable for an ailing friend or relative:
- Despondency caused by an experimental elixer from a Mad Botanist [[Adventure Locales, "Despair on Tap"](http://archive.wizards.com/default.asp?x=dnd/al/20040707a)]
- Weakness and muddled thinking caused by a Robe of Powerlessness [Dungeon Master's Guide Chapter 7 Magic Items]
- Inhabitation by a tsochar, if the victim is too fragile to survive other methods of removal [Lords of Madness Chapter 7, The Weavers of Flesh]
- Ceremorphosis (use with caution; this adds a strict time limit) [Lords of Madness Chapter 4, The Mind Flayers]
- Transformation into a yuan-ti tainted one (this has a gentler time limit of a week-ish) [Serpent Kingdoms page 18]
- Debauchery of the bacchae [Fiend Folio page 19]
- Feeblemindedness caused by a braxat [Monster Manual II page 38]
- Feeblemindedness caused by a nalfeshnee fiend of possession transformer [Fiendish Codex I page 25]
- Erratic behavior caused by a Symbol of Insanity carelessly left by a gynosphinx [Monster Manual page 234]

One apple splits into four sections each of which carries a Heal [Sunless Citadel page 28], so multiple characters can have ailments or loved ones with ailments. (Curiously, while the module bends reality to ensure that Kerowyn Hucrele's reward is always 250 gp per PC, it does not do the same here, so if more than four characters want a piece of the fruit then you're going to have problems. It seems like it would make more sense to leave Kerowyn Hucrele's reward static but ensure that the summer fruit yields exactly enough Heals for all the PCs who want one.)

I like to augment this hook with details on options for what a character might want to be cured of.

### <a id="pixie-amnesia"></a>  Amnesia

> Special Arrows (Ex): Pixies sometimes employ arrows that deal no damage but can erase memory...An opponent struck by this arrow must succeed on a DC 15 Will save or lose all memory...The subject retains skills, languages, and class abilities but forgets everything else until he or she receives a heal spell or memory restoration with limited wish, wish, or miracle.
>
> --- <cite>Monster Manual page 236</cite>

Amnesia is a hoary old cliche, but it's a hoary old cliche because it's so flexible.
- Maybe the first thing you remember is a clumsy pixie stammering apologies.
- Maybe the first thing you remember is an angry pixie yelling "and stay out!"
- Maybe the first thing you remember is running away because you're terrified of pixies.

Whatever the case, you don't remember your own name or what you were doing, and you need to get your memories back.

The upside of this is that recovered memories can serve as a hook for the next adventure, no matter how unrelated that adventure is to the Sunless Citadel. ("I just remembered --- I found the long-lost forge of Durgeddin the Black! We have to go back there!")

This is the simplest option, since it basically has no effect on gameplay whatsoever. As far as *this* adventure is concerned, it doesn't actually matter whether you don't know any of the locals because you lost your memory or because you're just a newcomer here.
