Starting off with a long digression about an obscure rule might not be starting on the best foot, but on the other hand, if you can't stand long digressions about obscure rules it's probably best you get a heads-up sooner than later.

The module opens by being helpfully explicit as to what sort of power level it expects the players to be playing with.

> The Sunless Citadel is a DUNGEONS & DRAGONS adventure suitable for four 1st-level player characters.
> Player characters (PCs) who survive the entire adventure should advance through 2nd level to 3rd level before the finale.

> --- <cite>The Sunless Citadel, page 2</cite>

The early going expects first-level characters, while the [Final Boss] is designed for third-level characters. The difference in power level between first level and third level is <em>big</em>, so you want to be sure the players don't run afoul of the Final Boss early. Fortunately, The Sunless Citadel, like many first-level adventures, is fairly linear and the players would have to <em>really</em> work to [Sequence Break].

Funny thing, though. Here's the first mention of experience points in the core rules:

> #### Experience and Levels
> The DM assigns XP to the characters at the end of each adventure based on what they have accomplished.
>
> A character can advance only one level at a time. If, for some extraordinary reason, a character's XP reward from a single adventure would be enough to advance two or more levels at once, he or she instead advances one level and gains just enough XP to be 1 XP short of the next level. Any excess experience points are not retained. For example, if Tordek has 5,000 XP (1,000 points short of 4th level) and gains 6,000 more, he would normally be at 11,000 XP --- enough for 5th level. Instead he attains 4th level, and his XP total stands at 9,999.

Harsh, but okay. When is the "adventure" over, by the way?

> #### Adventures
>
> One adventure might play out in a single game session; another might stretch across several sessions of play. A session lasts as long as you and your friends want to play, from a couple of hours to an all-day affair. The game can be stopped at any time and picked up wherever you left off when everyone gets back together. Every adventure is different, every quest unique.

That's...vague. Really vague. Really really vague.

Gaining a level isn't small potatoes; the difference between 2nd level and 3rd level can mean the difference between success and failure. And this difference is hung on a word that is itself undefined. Suppose the party eradicates a group of goblin bandits and learns in the process that the goblins were in bed with a creepy Mad Botanist making monsters in his Laboratory of Horrors. Is destroying the Laboratory of Horrors the same adventure, or a new one?

Unsurprisingly, players hate losing hard-earned XP, and so players always try to declare the end of the "adventure" whenever they need to. And it's sort of hard to argue with them, because who could be more qualified than *the adventurers* to declare when the "adventure" is over and a new "adventure" begins? (And if you try, the result will be the party turning about-face and slowly walking away from the dungeon until you say "Okay, okay, the adventure is over, new adventure now.")

So in practice, pretty much everyone --- including official published modules, including the first official printed module of 3rd Edition --- assumes that whenever the PCs have enough time and space to rest for eight hours, they can settle up on XP. In the extreme, this results in unironic versions of this scene:

> Milo stared up at the dark, dank masonry ceiling, following the patterns of the stone above him as his vision swam. At some point --- he couldn't remember when, which, all things considered, was concerning --- he'd been searched for anything even vaguely magical-looking. His Belt of Hidden Pouches, his Amulet of Protection From Evil, his anti-vampire paraphernalia, and, amusingly enough, his wand were all missing.
>
> He felt oddly like there were a pair of other spells he *should* know already but somehow... didn't. Like something was missing. The now-familiar feeling he had could only mean one thing: he'd levelled up.
>
>When a Wizard increases in level, they learn two new spells for free. This is supposed to be an instantaneous thing --- in fact, it is generally assumed that the spells learned were from ongoing research the Wizard was doing before levelling. This doesn't change the fact that if a Wizard goes through an incredibly violent day and, say, increases in level three times --- an unusual, but not impossible feat --- he can somehow perform months of spell research, not in the space of that one day, but *in the weeks leading up to it*.
>
>His hands twitched. His head felt like it might well explode if he didn't get these spells on paper soon. Looking around the dimly lit room --- a single flickering lamp provided what could generously be called light --- he noticed that his considerate hosts had failed to furnish his cell with a stationary kit.
>
>"I can't believe I'm reduced to this," he muttered (after heavy censorship, that is). Little-used rules [Complete Arcane page 187, if you wanted to know] allow a Wizard's forearm and upper arm to be used as three pages of spellbook each --- more than enough for his purposes. The long-term thinker in him was screaming in protest at the wastefulness, both in terms of time and money, of his plans, but cold pragmatism ruled here: he still had all of his 3rd-level spell slots filled, but he'd used the lion's share of his 1st- and 2nd-level spells in the battle with the Acromantulas (or was it Acromantulae? Milo could never tell).
>He had his paper analogue, but he still needed ink. With one last, choice curse (it was Orc, and it wouldn't translate, so don't ask) he bit deeply into the skin of his right index finger.
>
>How long had he been unconscious? Eight hours? More? Wincing with pain, he frantically scrawled the mystic words of power that were the keys to <em>Benign Transposition</em> and <em>Shatter</em> on his arm. The blood ran and spread, but it would do for now. It would have to.
