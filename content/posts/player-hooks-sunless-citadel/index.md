But wait! When preparing to run an adventure, character motivation is the *second* thing you need to worry about; the first is *player* motivation.

We basically aren't going to mention this ever again, and we certainly aren't going to get into a full psychology course on why people play games, but it's worth noting briefly, for context in designing character hooks, that ultimately character motivators need to appeal to the players, not the characters.

So what do the *players* want?

1. Catharsis: These players are here for a rip-roaring good time. They're not here to kill goblins; they're here to overkill goblins. They're here to deal massive damage, whether with a fireball or a giant axe.

 There's pretty much always some element of this, even when it's not the primary motivator, and that's why pretty much every adventure includes opportunities for over-the-top violence.

1. Teamwork: These players aren't interested in *how* they succeed so much as that they work together with their friends to do it. This is *not* the same thing as players having equal spotlight time; it's not about "the fighter gets to do his thing, then the rogue gets to do her thing, then..." Working *together* has to be central to success.

1. [Mastery](https://www.shamusyoung.com/twentysidedtale/?p=36902)[^challenge]: These players are here to git gud at something. A fantasy world serves well for this, because the real world is extremely hostile to any attempt to master it. Not only does mastering anything take a long time, but the real world has an annoying habit of changing the rules out from under you when you least expect it. Not to mention the real world comes with real-world consequences for failure. A lot more people would *like* to master, say, race-car driving, than actually will.

1. Flair: These players are here to do something with *style*. The two definitions I get for "flair" are "aptitude or ability for doing something well" and "stylishness and originality", and that's exactly the ambiguity I'm going for. This usually involves some level of mastery, but the ultimate goal is more like creative expression.

For these first four, it's usually worth going over what the gameplay of the adventure entails before asking anyone to create characters, to make sure it's something people actually want to play. This also pulls double duty in making sure they create characters they can actually use. For example, if you were pitching the Sunless Citadel to a gaming group from 2nd Edition, you could send out this:

> The Sunless Citadel is an action-oriented dungeoncrawl with light horror elements. It's fairly linear, to support a particular progression of mood. More specifically, the dungeon breaks cleanly into two halves.
>
> The front half centers around a war of attrition again an intelligent (but not too intelligent) community. For a change of pace, optional side-treks include clearing out infestations of wild beasts and raiding ancient tombs that the primary antagonists were too scared to touch. Some diplomatic encounters are possible, but with little real need for social skills --- they're mainly there just to let you decide whether you want to help any given NPC. Stealth is practically impossible. Mainline gameplay centers around jumping isolated groups of enemies, hitting hard and fast, and retreating to avoid getting overwhelmed by a unified army. Enemy security posture is poor, which makes for a gentle learning curve.
>
> The back half is a search-and-destroy mission in a hostile, horror-style environment. If you bother to interrogate any prisoners at all from the first half, you'll know going in who your target is. Having broken through the lines of defense in the front half, within the interior stealth is technically possible, depending on party composition --- you'll hit third level before the end of the adventure, and some third-level characters have options for stealth that first-level characters lack. But you can still adopt a "clear the dungeon" strategy, pacifying the environment as you go. There are no important opportunities for diplomacy in the back half.

...but for the case we're most interested in --- using the Sunless Citadel as an adventure for *new* players...new players aren't likely to know what they're going to want, so something like that is confusing and pointless.

The latter player motivators *are* directly related to character motivators:

<ol start="5">
  <li>Nation-building: First-level characters aren't going to actually build nations, but these players want their actions to have effects on the game world beyond the immediate. It's not enough to Save The Princess; the Princess has to issue new city charters and found grain banks and reform usufruct. The players don't necessarily need to have any economic understanding of what any of that means, but they need to see their actions having an effect on the kingdom. <em>Stopping</em> something works too --- prevent a war, halt a plague, seal the rift before the Elder God comes through. At low levels, put an end to the wild boar terrorizing a village.</li>
  <li>Immersion: These players are here to experience a fantasy world. They want to order a plate of sizzling chordevoc in the tavern, and see all the thatched roofs. They want to know what the goblins eat. To keep them happy, you need to use a lot of sleight-of-hand to make the world seem more lifelike than it really is.</li>
  <li>Narrative: And now we finally come to it. Players want to craft a story about their characters. When they're not being properly fed, they start trying to take over the story with something from their backstory. (Overly-elaborate backstories are always a warning sign to keep track of.)</li>
</ol>

The adventure needs to provide a narrative structure that can work for *all* the characters. It needs NPCs to serve as the secondary cast for the main characters to play off of. NPCs can also be the proximate motivators for action, because nation-building is all well and good but we need *particular* farmers to talk to about the boar destroying their fields.

It's this last that drives the need for *character* hooks. For each PC, we need to know why they get involved at all, what they expect to get out of it. (We should also have a *rough* idea what they will *actually* get out of it in terms of their character arc, but obviously that's hard to know in advance. If we knew exactly how the characters were going to develop, we wouldn't need to actually play the games.)



[^challenge]: [The Angry GM calls mastery "challenge"](https://theangrygm.com/how-to-motivate-a-bunch-of-lying-liars/), but I hate that term. A version of the game in which you had to eat a pinecone every time you rolled a die would be more *challenging*, but good luck finding players who would prefer that game.

 Indenting a quoteblock includes the quoteblock in a footnote, but doesn't make it look decent...

 > To be clear, I'm not complaining that the game is "too hard"...The problem here isn't how hard it is, but where the focus is.
 >
 > Let's look at how other games handle their mechanics. Let's look at the Arkham series.
 >
 > In Arkham, the game begins with a simple base of brawling mechanics and gradually layers depth and complexity as you master these elements. These elements combine to give you more options in a fight. New enemy types require different approaches, and the game even has different difficulty levels to accommodate players of different skill and frustration thresholds.
