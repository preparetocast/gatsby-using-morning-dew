## Aboleths

[![aboleth](https://pathfinderwiki.com/mediawiki/images/a/a4/Aboleth_drawing_a_rune.jpg "Aboleth")](https://pathfinderwiki.com/wiki/Aberration)

The aboleth civilization covered the world in intradiluvian times, when all the world was covered by a great ocean. In those days, the Elemental Plane of Air was further from the Elemental Plane of Earth than it is now, so that Air and Earth could not coexist in direct contact.

Aboleth ruins, when they are found (which is rarely, anymore), are not thousands of years old --- they are millions of years old.
The stone structures of aboleth ruins look like nothing so much as petrified shells of giant shellfish.[Lords of Madness page 31]

Aboleth ruins are best known for their glyphs --- writings which carry magical effects, which yet endure even today. Some of minor; some are very powerful. Kingdoms have been founded atop aboleth glyphs.

> The written language of the aboleths is likewise complex, with hundreds of thousands of intricate glyphs similar to abstract hieroglyphics. An aboleth writes upon stone or metal with tiny, thimblelike devices made of crystal that fit over the tips of its tentacles. The aboleth dips the crystals into dense acids that are not easily washed away by water, and then etches the runes directly into the stone or metal tablets. All four tentacle tips are used simultaneously to etch the runes; a creature with only one or two hands takes a proportionally longer time to write in Aboleth.

Few wonder just what became of the aboleths.

They didn't die out.

> An aboleth's membranes dry quite rapidly once the creature is out of water; under such conditions, it takes 2 points of Dexterity damage per hour (to a minimum Dexterity of 1).
>
> An aboleth whose membranes remain dry does not die. It merely enters a state of suspended animation similar to sleep, except that the creature remains aware of its surroundings. It can hear and see, but cannot detect odors or feel tactile sensations. The creature's natural armor gains a bonus of +6 (which offsets the loss of Dexterity), and it gains damage reduction 5/adamantine. It retains the ability to think and observe, but it can take no actions, not even purely mental actions. Inside, it remains moist and functional; an aboleth in this state that is badly cut or pierced leaks and quickly bleeds to death. Left undisturbed, though, it can remain in this state forever. This is known to aboleths as the long dreaming and is considered a fate far worse than death.

But with luck, an aboleth can recover from the long dreaming. And so too can the lost aboleth empire recover from its destruction.

> This damage can be cured by magic or by immersion in water (which cures all damage and rehydrates the membranes at the rate of 2 points of Dexterity per minute).

Aboleths are being revivified all the time, sometimes by accident, sometimes by those foolish enough to believe they can use the aboleth. Sometimes by loyal servants sent by related aboleths living in the remaining oceans. All the greatest aboleth cities and estates were built atop, or inside, the highest mountains and plateaus of the seafloor, but many aboleths yet living in the deeper, still-submerged depths.

> Tentacle +12 melee (1d6+8 plus slime)
>
> Slime (Ex): A blow from an aboleth's tentacle can cause a terrible affliction. A creature hit by a tentacle must succeed on a DC 19 Fortitude save or begin to transform over the next 1d4+1 minutes, the skin gradually becoming a clear, slimy membrane. An afflicted creature must remain moistened with cool, fresh water or take 1d12 points of damage every 10 minutes...A remove disease spell cast before the transformation is complete will restore an afflicted creature to normal. Afterward, however, only a heal or mass heal spell can reverse the affliction.

In the deep ocean --- such as when attacking another aboleth --- this condition is usually fatal, since a creature struck will usually die before it can get to fresh water. But a surface-dweller can, with luck, obtain fresh water every 10 minutes. (Of course, a first-level character would be nearly killed outright by the blow itself, but might survive with luck and care.)

This ailment is hugely inconvenient for the character, but not for the player.

The character has to sleep in a water-filled tub with a damp cloth over their face hanging into the water (the cloth wicks water upward via capillary action, keeping the face moist). This makes sleeping in a dungeon almost impossible, but Oakhurst is nearby, so the party can always return to town to sleep.

The rules are silent on exactly *how much* water the character needs every ten minutes. Obviously the character will have to carry extra water, but we can say for a day of applying water every ten minutes they only need, say, a gallon --- eight pounds. [That is, we simply double the amount of water they're normally assumed to need.](https://www.d20srd.org/srd/environment.htm#starvationAndThirst)
