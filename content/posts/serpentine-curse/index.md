Ophidianism, also called the Serpentine Curse, is a supernatural curse that spreads like a disease, sometimes tragically mistaken for lycanthropy. A humanoid bitten by an ophidian transforms into an ophidian over sixteen to nineteen days --- its skin grows scaly, its legs begin to shrink and fuse together, and its tongue becomes forked [Fiend Folio page 134].

If the process completes, the victim suffers total amnesia, which makes them vulnerable to swift indoctrination into a cult, and that is where most ophidians are found: worshipping charismatic dragons, naga, or (especially) yuan-ti.

Even if the "newborn" ophidian is safely with its (former) loved ones instead of in captivity, it will usually flee those now-strangers in confusion and panic, and be picked up by its apparent family.

If the victim gets aid before the process completes, it can be halted. A third-level Healer --- not *that* hard to find --- can halt the progress of the curse with a Remove Disease spell [Miniatures Handbook page 11]. The curse can also be stopped by a chiang lung (river dragon) [Oriental Adventures page 156], which are very rare but are tireless foes of the Serpentine Curse and can save one victim every six seconds until they collapse from exhaustion --- more than once the fortuitous arrival of a chiang lung has saved villagers from the consequences of a mass ophidian attack.

In place of the languages they previously spoke, ophidians speak the common tongue, as well as the yuan-ti language, the knowledge of it shoved into their brains as the transformation erases the last vestiges of their old life. Many scholars infer that the curse was created by yuan-ti, though no one is certain exactly which yuan-ti, or when or where. The curse is, obviously, self-sustaining at this point, so many yuan-ti unrelated to the original creators are making use of it.

## Yuan-ti

Yuan-ti are descended from humans whose bloodlines were mingled with those of snakes [Monster Manual page 262] at the direction of the dark god Merrshaulk, a deity of the destructive aspect of plant life [Monster Manual page 263].

Merrshaulk resides beyond the Material Plane in a rainforest of dazzling iridescent colors but also acid rain and deadly poisons [Manual of the Planes page 103]. It is said that though the light gets dimmer as you descend through the canopies, there is no forest floor to reach.

Yuan-ti have a bit of an identity crisis as monsters. On the one hand they're giant snake-people who live in fetid jungles and rip out the still-beating hearts out of human sacrifices in crumbling stone temples. (For reasons known only to themselves, yuan-ti are partial to taking over other people's ancient ruins, if they're sufficiently isolated [Monster Manual page 263].) On the other hand there are human-looking yuan-ti who live incognito among humans.

Yuan-ti are usually (>50%) chaotic evil, so yuan-ti passing for human can sometimes lead to strained relations between humans and, say, elves. Among the wood elves of the deep jungle, it is a well-known "fact" that humans and yuan-ti are in fact one species, just with different degrees of snake.

Despite the East-Asian-sounding name, as far as I can locate there is no such mythological monster in any East Asian mythology. Greek mythology, however, certainly has a snake-man: the legendary Alexander the Great was the son of a human woman and a snake. (The actual historical Alexander the Great was the son of King Philip of Macedon...as far as we know...)

That gives us something to work with. What happens when yuan-ti infiltrate the upper echelons of human society?

Begin at the beginning. Olympias, real name Myrtle (like the flower), was allegedly the daughter of King Neoptolemus I of Epirus, king of the Molossians.
When Neoptolemus I died in 360 BC, his brother Arybbas took the throne.

Myrtle was a member of the cult of the Dionysian Mysteries, known for their wine-induced Bacchic frenzy. (Bacchus was an epithet of Dionysos; his female followers were known as bacchae in the translated Latin, as passed down from Euripides' last play, The Bacchae.) The cult's secret meetings featured ecstatic dancing, singing, and revelry.

In 358 BC, Arybbas made an alliance with Macedon, and in 357 BC, Arybbas married his niece Myrtle off to King Philip II of Macedon, who already had three wives but nevertheless agreed to marry Myrtle. Myrtle's younger brother, Alexander, went with her to Macedon. It was a decision that Arybbas would live to regret.
After moving to Macedon, Myrtle began to call herself Olympias and gave birth to two children, Alexander in 356 BC and Cleopatra in 355 BC.
Alexander may have been named for Myrtle's brother, Alexander I of Epirus, not to be confused with Alexander I of Macedon. But since he was the third Alexander of Macedon, he was Alexander III, not Alexander II.

Philip II's third wife, Philinna of Larissa, bore a son Philip III around the same time, but Philip III was widely considered stupid and not a contender for the throne.

In 350 BC, Philip overthrew Arybbas and installed Alexander --- you know what, how about we just call him "Myrtle's younger brother" --- on Arybbas' former throne. Arybbas fled to Athens (he would die peacefully in 342 BC).

Philip conquered Greece in 338 BC, and over the course of the following year created the Cornthian League. At its first meeting, the league decided to conduct a war against Persia and elected Philip commander of its armed forces.
But all was not well in Philip's marriage. Philip walked in on Olympias sleeping with a snake, which "abated Philip's passion for her" according to Plutarch of Chaeronea.
In 337 BC, Philip married his seventh wife, Cleopatra of Macedon, who changed her name to Eurydice upon their marriage, out of a heartfelt desire to distinguish herself from her stepdaughter for the benefit of future storytellers. Some say her name-change just made everything more confusing (not least because Philip's first wife *also* changed her name to Eurydice after marriage), but her heart was in the right place.
By mutual agreement, Olympias went into exile to the court of her brother Alexander, along with her son Alexander.
Philip was heard to remark that Alexander (Olympias's son) was not his son, and it appeared he might disinherit Alexander in favor of the newborn daughter Europa of his new wife, Eurydice. (Not to be confused with his old wife Eurydice.)

*Coincidentally*, at that point Alexander (Myrtle's younger brother) and Cleopatra (Philip's daughter and Alexander's niece, not Philip's new wife) asked Philip for his blessing to marry.
At this point we may safely assume that Philip took a long look at his daughter, then a long look at his brother-in-law, then at his daughter again, and finally decided that as far as he was concerned, this whole crazy Molossian family could do whatever they wanted.
In October 336 BC, Philip attended their grand wedding, where he was assassinated, no doubt by wicked Persians who were absolutely not connected to Alexander, Cleopatra, Olympias, or Alexander.
Alexander promptly seized the throne of Macedon --- that's Philip's son Alexander, not the Alexander who was getting married that day --- while Olympias arranged for Eurydice and Europa to be killed.

Alexander smoothly took over Philip's war preparations. Just before Alexander invaded Persia, Olympias reportedly told him that Philip was right, that Alexander's true father was not Philip, but Zeus.
She would never see her son alive again.
Alexander conquered Persia...and Ehypt...and Syria...and Mesopotamia...and Bactria...and the Punjab. But in 323 BC, he fell ill with a fever. His council asked who would inherit his recently-acquired, vast and unstable empire. His answer was simple: "I leave it to the strongest."

Macedon fell into the hands of Perdiccas, then Antipater, then Polyperchon, and finally Cassander, ruling with the slow-witted Philip III as his figurehead. When Cassander took his army out to fight in one of the endless wars, he left Philip's wife --- the one who had convinced Philip III to side with Cassander over Polyperchon --- as the de facto ruler of Macedon.
Olympias pounced on the unguarded Macedon, and Philip III discovered to his cost that his guards were loyal to Olympias, not to him. Eurydice briefly escaped but was soon also captured. Olympias executed them both, along with one hundred of Cassander's most prominent supporters, and declared her infant grandson Alexander IV as King.
Cassander, however, returned alive and surrounded Olympias at Pydna, a harbor town at the foot of the holy mountain Olympus. Her allies tried to break the siege, but were repulsed. Olympias negotiated a surrender on the condition that Cassander spare her life, [only for Cassander to execute her anyway](https://allthetropes.fandom.com/wiki/I_Lied).

*That* is the kind of thing that happens when yuan-ti infiltrate and take over the government.

As an aside, here's an amusing tidbit of *actual* history: according to an anonymous source who spoke to Plutarch of Chaeronea, when the queen dowager heard about Alexander the Great claiming to be the son of Zeus, she joked "When will my son stop slandering me to Hera?" (Hera being Zeus's wife, who he was effectively accusing his mother of committing adultery against.)

## No snake people need apply

As a result of yuan-ti depredations, anywhere yuan-ti are known, human commmunities tend to be vigorous about persecuting any visible snake-people to the point of running them out of town. Because anyone who objects to the injustice must be a secret yuan-ti cultist, and you're not a secret yuan-ti cultist...*are you*?

The Fiend Folio gives no explicit mechanics for a *partial* ophidian transformation, but we can make some reasonable inferences.
First, the subject's skin grows scaly.

> Their scales are typically mottled green and yellow, with brown, black, and red sometimes appearing in certain individuals. Their scales naturally change color to help the creatures blend into wooded or subterranean surroundings...+10 bonus on Hide checks in forests or underground areas due to their chameleonlike ability to alter their skin tones.

> --- <cite>Fiend Folio pages 133--134</cite>

That's actually a nice bonus for an adventurer, but another effect that comes with it isn't so pleasant: their legs begin to shrink and fuse together. A full ophidian has a land speed of only 20feet/6sec but gets a climb speed and a swim speed in the bargain [Fiend Folio page 133]; the partial transformation makes no mention of getting a full-length tail, so we may infer that the victim doesn't get the climb speed nor the swim speed.
Instead, their speed is simply reduced to 20feet/6sec if Medium-sized or 15feet/6sec if Small.
(If the Curse were allowed to run its course, then short-legged people like halflings and gnomes would get the speed loss cancelled out by an increase in overall size to Medium, but the size increase does not come in the early stages.)

A partial ophidian transformation also comes with a forked tongue --- this may temporarily interfere with speech, but since full ophidians can speak normally, so can partial cases, even if it takes a while for them to get used to the new tongue.

The ophidian curse is the most mixed bag on the list --- an adventurer might actually miss that Hide bonus after they complete this adventure and get their Serpentine Curse removed.
