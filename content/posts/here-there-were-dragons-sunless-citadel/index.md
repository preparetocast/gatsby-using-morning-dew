I'm going to be harping on this a *lot*, but the Sunless Citadel is *really good* at getting across a palpable feeling of decay and decrepitude.

I didn't really understand what the Sunless Citadel was doing with this the first time through. This is hard to really appreciate without seeing someone screw it up; that's one of the reasons it's worth digging into bad modules even with no intention of fixing them. Fortunately, other people have already done that for us.

> We've barely finished talking about Chekhov's Gun, and Thunderspire Labyrinth is doing it wrong already...the module isn't subtle in showing off its flavour. The players approach the undermountain through "a 50-foot-tall stone archway hewn out of the mountainside", on each side of which "a towering minotaur statue stands [...] glowering down at travellers."

Beholders are a classic enemy and one of the great things about 4th Edition is that the Monster Manual II comes complete with low-level versions of iconic monsters, so that even a 4th-level party can tangle with an Eye Tyrant.

Never mind that the developers inexplicably drew a Beholder on the dungeon's door - it's all just a fake out. If you don't reset their expectations quickly, your disappointed players will spend hours searching the Chamber for secret doors, convinced they still haven't found the room with the Beholder in it.

Nobody is going to be expecting dragons in the Sunless Citadel. This seems so natural that you usually never notice what the module is doing *right* here.

It never does become clear what happened to the Citadel itself; it doesn't really matter, because it isn't relevant to the story we're telling *in the present*.

> Maybe something like the book found in Balin's Tomb in Lord of the Rings, detailing the civil war and eventual collapse of the city? Balin's Tomb and Mountains of Madness - in both these examples, the past of the dungeon complex has a direct bearing on the final resolution of the story. The fall of the dwarves is important because it's building up to the Balrog; the ancient things living in the Mountains of Madness are still alive and active. Understanding the prologue is critical to comprehending the finale.

The Sunless Citadel is a castle that's been thrust down below ground level by ancient and terrible, but now long-past, magic.
The citadel has been long picked-over. Exploring the crumbling ruin is a post-post-post-post-apocalyptic feeling --- there were vast forces at work here at *some* point, but you and your adversaries are just rats in their long shadow.

It's a good setup for a long-running campaign. One of the unusual features of D&D-descended games is the very wide range of power levels in a single game. High-level adventures are supposed to look radically different from low-level adventures. The Sunless Citadel introduces those elements while keeping them firmly offscreen where they can't upstage the actual story.

And if it were just some goblins squatting in an old ruin, that would be fine. It would be a serviceable adventure. But there's more going on under the surface.

Nobody is going to be expecting dragons in the Sunless Citadel; indeed it's only the PCs who bothered with a Gather Information check who even know that there was "an ancient dragon cult" here. And in this case, that is as it should be. Even without specifically mentioning it, we're setting up what we need to.

The Sunless Citadel [failed to properly set up the goblins](/sunless-citadel-adventure-synopsis#durbuluks-raided-road) and [didn't set up the twig blights to a degree that even comes close to reflecting the size of their eventual role in the story](/rumors-heard-in-oakhurst) --- but here is where it really starts to shine, when setting up the kobold cult. The kobold cult is never explicitly referenced before they show up; they're a surprise. But the module is building up the *themes* that the kobolds will rely on. A once-proud site now defiled by interlopers.

> the pillars are generally worn and broken, and graffiti in the Dwarven alphabet covers most of them. Characters who know Goblin (after translating the letters from Dwarven) recognize the inscriptions as warnings and threats against potential trespassers.
>
> --- <cite>The Sunless Citadel, page 5</cite>

The ruined Citadel itself is a palpable presence in the adventure, seemingly just a backdrop --- only to suddenly become important to the plot when we meet the kobolds who want to restore it to (their imagined version of) its former glory.

Having said that, it does garble the message a little bit that, if you stop to think about it, these pillars the goblins are defiling can't have been original to the site. Pillars on two opposite sides of a ravine sounds like a rope bridge has rotted away --- and in the original time of the Citadel, there was no ravine here and thus no need for a bridge. Unless, I suppose, the ravine was already here before the Citadel got buried...it isn't ultimately all that important.

The Citadel still isn't important for what really happened so long ago --- whatever that might be. The Citadel is important for the ideologies and fervent beliefs that hinge upon it *now*.

But of course, the people who are making the strongest impression right now aren't the kobolds --- they're the goblins.

## Gang Tags

I like this. It's tough to introduce a villain in a game, because obviously when they actually meet the players are going to win. The trick is to introduce them before they actually show up --- show their effects on the land around them. This graffiti is establishing the goblins...but it's mostly establishing them as losers, as befits an adversary that the PCs are soon going to outgrow. I mean, really now. Graffiti. This is not, as a rule, how Dark Lords mark their territory. More often they let impaled corpses stand as mute testament to what happens to trespassers. Or at least bas-relief carvings of a king stabbing someone's eyes out. But the Durbuluks don't have the resources for that. They're not destitute like the kobolds, but they're not rich either. If they lived in a city, we'd call them a street gang. They're bottom-feeders, scavengers who prey on the weak.

## Campfires

So we're starting to get some good setup of the upcoming factions. We also get...uh, this.

> A successful Search check (DC 13) reveals that the area in and around the pillars has hosted countless small campfires, some of them recent (about a month ago). However, someone went to some effort to hide the evidence of the camps from casual scrutiny.
>
> -- <cite>The Sunless Citadel, page 5</cite>

Remember [the Gather Information section](/rumors-heard-in-oakhurst), when we talked about how it's important to have a list of what information you're trying to get across to players? Yeah, that would be really helpful right about now. If the players investigate further, I have no idea what further clues they might find, because I have no idea what the truth is.

In the first place, what is this even saying? Did someone try to hide the evidence of *all* the camps, or just the ones a month ago? It sounds like it means all. But that makes no sense. The goblins have no reason to hide their camps. *Their gang tags are right above the camps.* The goblins aren't hiding their presence. Quite the opposite.

A month ago is when the human adventurers passed through here. But they had no reason to camp here. The players will surely be aware of this, because *they* have been considering (or will soon be considering) the question of whether *they* need to camp here...and they don't.

Plus, "some" of the campfires were recent, not "one" of the campfires.

That leaves...the kobolds? I guess...the kobolds camped here about a month ago? For...some kind of recon?

To be clear, if that was the intent (I'm not totally sure it was), I'd be all for some environmental storytelling, hinting at the kobolds' presence as [the players roughly follow the timeline of the kobold invasion](https://www.shamusyoung.com/twentysidedtale/?p=40734) --- first see where they staked out the ravine, then see the goblins they killed, then finally meet the kobolds.

But the clues are *weird*. Maybe the kobolds showed up right before the adventurers a month ago, fine, but why camp here? I guess...maybe the kobolds weren't *sure* whether there was anyone squatting in their holy temple (because none of the kobolds talked to anyone in Oakhurst) and since they weren't sure whether whoever left the graffiti might be long gone, they camped here figuring it was a small risk and they could retreat if they saw anyone? And then they did see a goblin, shanked the goblin and retreated? That's possible, but it'd be poor storytelling because there's no sign of the kobolds returning the second time. If we're going for environmental storytelling of the kobold invasion, there's a big chunk missing.

Honestly, lacking anything better, I would just drop all mention of these campsites. It doesn't seem to lead anywhere coherent.

There is, however, some clear evidence of the adventurers' passage.

> Anyone standing next to the ravine immediately notes a sturdy knotted rope tied to one of the leaning pillars. The rope hangs down into the darkness below.
>
> --- <cite>The Sunless Citadel, page 5</cite>

Of course. The adventurers went down. They never came back up. So their rope is still here. There's that mute testimony; this is far more unnerving than the goblins' deliberate threats.

I do have a nitpick, though.

> Judging by its good condition, the rope couldn't have been tied there any longer than two or three weeks ago.
>
> --- <cite>The Sunless Citadel, page 5</cite>

This *has* to be an error, and it's sort of [archeologically](https://www.shamusyoung.com/twentysidedtale/?p=22587) interesting because it shows that the timeline went through multiple versions in different drafts of the module. The adventurers "delved into the Sunless Citadel a month past." [The Sunless Citadel, page 3] The campfires --- whatever the heck was supposed to be going on there --- date to "about a month ago" [The Sunless Citadel, page 5] In the citadel itself, PCs find "month-old tracks made by three or four humanoids (not goblins or kobolds)" [The Sunless Citadel, page 15] What happened to the adventurers after that? "The goblins caught three of them over a month ago" [The Sunless Citadel, page 19]

So according to the module, the missing adventurers couldn't have left this rope. Nor could the kobolds have arrived after the adventurers [The Sunless Citadel, page 14] so the kobolds didn't leave this rope.

It's kind of weird that the 5e update repeats all of this verbatim, despite the fact that it's a clear and simple misprint.

Obviously we shouldn't be telling the players that "the rope couldn't have been tied there any longer than two or three weeks ago," because if the players are paying attention they'll think it's a clue that someone else came down here *after* the month-past adventurers --- when it's not a clue at all. Fortunately it's an easy fix --- just say the rope has been here a month instead of "two or three weeks". (Unless, of course, you shorten the timeline as I'll advocate later.)

This rope brings up another thorny issue when introducing new players to the game.
Because there's a cliff, and the PCs need to get down it. They need rope.

> No rope! And only last night you said to yourself: "Sam, what about a bit of rope? You'll want it, if you haven't got it": Well, I'll want it. I can't get it now.
>
> --- <cite>Samwise the Brave</cite>

You could *tell* players "Hey, make sure you buy rope" but that would just be annoying. They should be able to learn to play the game by *playing the game*.

The Player's Handbook provides example "starting packages" to clue players in as to the sort of gear they need --- but obviously those packages don't include things that the *party* needs, like rope, only things that the individual *characters* need.

Of course, in this case, there's a rope waiting for the PCs when they get to the ravine.

I don't mean that we're trying to encourage players to have *rope*, per se. But I submit that having-the-stuff-you-need is part of the game, and an important part.

"Dungeoneering" is a cutesy word I use, lifted from the Alexandrian's old joke:

> Player: I want to explore the dungeon.
>
> GM: Okay, make a Dungeoneering check.
>
> Player: I succeed.
>
> GM: Okay, you kill a tribe of goblins and emerge with 546 gp in loot.
>
> --- <cite>[Game Structures](http://thealexandrian.net/wordpress/15126/roleplaying-games/game-structures)</cite>

You don't have to use *this* word, but I think it's important to have *a* word to keep track of this concept, because it can be difficult to pin down and describe on the fly.

Dungeoneering is the third stage of the three-stage process of players acclimating to the world. I don't think the first two stages really need names of their own (people with fancy degrees might call them "perceivable consequence" and "intention"), since they're simple enough concepts but we need to talk about them first to clarify what dungeoneering is and is *not*.

In the first stage, the player learns the literal rules. They learn their options for stealth and detection. They learn how to climb a cliff and under what circumstances they might fall. They learn how to move the little chess pieces around in combat, and they learn they can get a bonus for flanking an enemy.

In the second stage, the players develops the ability to *make plans*. It's not just that they know (or can look up) what a car is, what a train is, and what a plane is. They learn to chain together multiple elements of the world the way a native would, as naturally as a person in our world realizes that getting from one place to another might involve a plane *and* a train *and* a taxicab, a kind of car you can hire for a single trip. They think of elements of the world as tools in their toolbox, and instinctively reach for the appropriate tool in any situation.

Dungeoneering is the third stage, when players learn to *anticipate* and pre-empt the internal logic of the world. "A blind corner...I don't like it. Looks like a good spot for an ambush." "Don't let the goblins get away, they'll bring reinforcements." "A ravine? We'll want rope."

The third stage isn't necessarily natural to the in-universe characters, and so dumb mistakes aren't necessarily a bad thing. If a player tries to run right past some goblins because they don't know about Attacks of Opportunity, it's a good idea to coach them to alter their course --- because Attacks of Opportunity are an abstract representation of a danger that would be *impossible* to overlook in-universe. But an impetuous youth trying to adventure for the first time might well just plum forget to bring rope, much as how a first-time hiker in our world might completely forget to bring water. (But a D&D character wouldn't forget to bring water; in a medieval world, anyone who's gone on a journey of any length, including the journey to Oakhurst from wherever they were before, would have a deep appreciation for the lack of running water in the wilderness.)

On the other hand, what if there *wasn't* rope? Do the PCs walk all the way back to town? That wouldn't be so bad --- it would be boring and slightly humiliating for the characters, but for the players it only takes a few seconds. But new players are all too likely to *not realize that bringing rope was an option*. Sure, it's in the Player's Handbook, but they aren't going to read that thing cover-to-cover. More likely they'd just try to climb down, not realizing they were *supposed* to bring rope.

Indeed, the cliff actually enables that --- if PCs are too paranoid to use somebody else's rope but not quite paranoid enough to bring their own, there *are* goblin-carved handholds and footholds on the rock-face itself [The Sunless Citadel, page 5].

The conceit of a previous adventuring party helps us find a middle ground. There's a rope waiting for them, but the rope was brought here by adventurers just like them.

In fact, there's more we could do with this idea. The previous adventurers had a bullseye lantern --- and the players might well not have thought to invest in one. Unless you're a coal miner's daughter, you probably don't spend a lot of time thinking about how you could use mirrors to maximize the "throw" of a lantern.
But the module gives the bullseye lantern to Sir Braford, at the very *end* of the adventure --- we could put the bullseye lantern with the body of Karakas, near the beginning, for the PCs to find and go "Hey, this thing is handy!"

On the other hand, using the previous adventurers as models to emulate creates a weird dynamic. Because the previous adventurers failed --- that's the entire reason the PCs are here, that's the hook for the rescue mission. It feels more natural to use the previous adventurers to warn the players away from dangerous mistakes. "They did X, and they failed, don't do X." Indeed we could show where the party members were killed off, one by one, by the various dangers of the Citadel. But that brings us to the upcoming ambush.
