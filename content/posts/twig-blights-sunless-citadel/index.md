Twig blights were revised in the Monster Manual II, and I think it was an improvement. The only difference (apart from bumping up their Hide bonus and giving them Listen) was to change the effects of their poison. The original poison was a fairly difficult Fortitude save or take...1 extra hit point in damage, immediately, with no secondary effects. There is a tiny bit of nuance introduced by that --- because part of the twig blight's damage is gated behind a Fortitude save, character with low hit points but high Fort saves, like clerics, can hold up surprisingly well. But mostly, it hardly seems worth the bother.

The Monster Manual II brought the Fortitude DC way down, to 11 --- but if a PC fails the save, the effects are more serious: a point of Strength damage. That introduces some extra bookkeeping, tracking changes to characters' attack bonuses, but it gives the twig blights a gimmick to help them stand out. With luck, the players might even get nervous when engaging twig blights, because twig blights can weaken them in a way goblin short swords can't. (Probably not, but every little bit of enemies-feeling-different-to-fight helps.)

That wasn't the last time the twig blights were revised. The Monster Manual II clarified that "A twig blight gains skills and feats as a fey." --- because in 3.0 plants didn't gain skills nor feats, but twig blights were supposed to be sneaky. Later the designers realized that the whole "plant creatures don't have skills" idea was kind of stupid, and 3.5 made plant monsters work just like any other type of monster.

The 3.5 update settled on "Hide +8, Listen +1, Move Silently +4, Spot +1" for the twig blight's skills.

Neither The Sunless Citadel nor the Monster Manual II specified any Hide bonus for a twig blight in a wooded area, but it would be reasonable to give them a circumstance bonus. There's no need to worry about that too much, though --- with Hide, natural camouflage is already factored into handwavy DM judgements of what exactly qualifies as "cover" or "concealment" that allows a character (or monster) to make a Hide check at all.

The 3.5 update also gave twig blights Damage Reduction 5/bludgeoning or slashing as part of the 3.5 drive to unify all the various monster resistances into the Damage Reduction mechanic. If a character is holding a piercing melee weapon when the twig blights attack, they'll find it ineffective. Don't be coy about this; be explicit that the spear (for example) slips between gaps in the twig blgihts' bodies and that the character will likely need to switch weapons. This would be perfectly clear to a person who was actually standing there, but might not be obvious to a player at a table just trying to figure out why their attacks don't seem to do anything.

I think the revised stats are cleaner, simpler, and better to use, so those are what we'll be assuming when talking about stealth and detection.




Getting back to the ambush, assume the twig blights take 10 on their Hide and Move Silently checks. Listen checks take a -1 penalty per 10 feet of distance.[Player's Handbook Chapter 4: Skills] At a distance of 70 feet, a character with no Listen ranks but a +2 Wis bonus (or who happens to be an elf and has a +2 bonus from that) has a total -5 modifier to Listen checks, so rolling a 20 they can tie 15...but the higher modifier wins ties, so they cannot actually succeed on the Listen check until 60 feet.

So we can declare that 60 feet is when we'll start rolling Spot and Listen checks --- that's within the plausible range for the limit of line-of-sight, if the twig blights are in foliage --- assuming no character has a particularly high Listen bonus. (If all character's Listen modifiers are particularly low, it's still usually easier to roll a few hopeless Listen checks then to do the math to figure out exactly where they might succeed. Of course, if a character does have particularly good ears, we should take that into account.)

Of course, if the party is carrying a torch, then the twig blights will see them coming long before they can possibly detect the twig blights --- and thus, by the time they arrive, the twig blights will already be concealed and stationary, making Listen checks to detect them infeasible.

If the party is not slowing down to make extra Spot checks, then each party member makes only two Spot checks, opposed by the two twig blights' Hide checks. Assume the twig blights take 10 on their Hide checks, so Spotting them requires beating a Hide result of 19.

If either side is aware of the other before anyone on the other side is aware, then they can choose their moment to initiate combat.

> Kobolds lurk in the nooks and crannies, waiting for the right time to strike. Jozan spots one of the kobolds, and the kobolds shriek and charge. The kobolds and Jozan each get a standard action during the surprise round. Kobolds that are close enough can charge adventurers and attack them. Others can move to try to put themselves in advantageous positions or shoot arrows at the flat-footed party members. Jozan can cast a spell, attack, or take some other action.

If the party comes within 20 feet of the twig blights without spotting them, then the twig blights get to charge and attack in the surprise round.

A penalty applies on Spot checks to determine the distance at which an encounter begins (which includes all Spot checks we care about), -1 per 10 feet of distance between the two individuals or groups, and an additional -5 penalty may apply if the character making the Spot check is distracted (not concentrating on being observant).[Player's Handbook Chapter 4: Skills]

Avoiding the twig blights' surprise charge requires Spotting them at 30 feet. Spotting the twig blights at 30 feet --- with a -3 penalty for distance --- requires a Spot bonus of +3 or better. (And if the character's Spot bonus is exactly +3, it requires a roll of 20.) If a character with a +6 Spot bonus rolls an 18 for a total of 23, then they Spot the twig blights at a distance of 40 feet --- the furthest distance at which the distance penalty allows them to beat the twig blight's Hide check.

The party has the advantage that they get a total of eight Spot rolls --- one for each party member for each twig blight. But it's all for naught if none of them has a Spot bonus of at least +3.

If the party *isn't* carrying a light source, then the twig blights don't detect them before 60 feet either, but since we assumed for simplicity that the night is bright enough to allow creatures with low-light vision (including twig blights) to see as if it were daylight, most likely the twig blights immediately freeze (since the party cannot Hide while walking along the road) and still no Listen checks are called for.

If we assumed a darker night, then the twig blights would actually have to roll to Spot (or hear) the PCs.

The PCs could also potentially Hide if they abandoned the Old Road to trek through the foliage themselves --- which technically they might, if they're under no time pressure, but we'll ignore that.



So, how does the encounter play out?

Twig blights have Int 5. They can speak (Sylvan). They know what armor is. They'll charge whichever character is least obviously armored. (Even if that character is a monk; twig blights aren't very bright.) If possible, they will flank that character, but that might not be possible depending on the PCs' marching order on the road --- charging from one side of the road, the twig blights cannot get around to the far side of the character and attack. (Unless for some reason the character was very close to the foliage, so that the twig blights could charge diagonally and attack from front and back.) (Twig blights won't attack a more heavily armored character, even if they could flank that character; twig blights always prey on the weak.)

The most notable feature of the twig blights is their quasi-suicidal bloodlust. In contrast to cowardly goblins and plodding zombies we'll see later, twig blights have a feral madness to them. We can play this up even as the twig blights fall to the PCs' blows, describing how the monster madly-but-weakly flails with its claws as if it cares nothing for its own injuries.

It's a good idea to note in advance, at character creation, how much the characters are carrying and thus how many points of Strength damage would increase their encumbrance. Since we're in the unique situation of this being the first-ever encounter, it's much easier to keep track of exactly how much weight each character is carrying than it otherwise would be. (When the characters are on their way *back* from the dungeon, you'll probably hit the point of just totaling their load limits rather than micromanage who is carrying how many goblin short swords.)
It won't slow the party down for long, since they'll almost certainly be able to redistribute the weight to lighten that one character's load, but it'll definitely make an impression if the injured character initially can't keep up due to being weakened by venom.



### Addendum: customizing twig blights

The 3.5 update settled on "Hide +8, Listen +1, Move Silently +4, Spot +1" for the twig blight's skills.
That is, the default twig blight has one rank in each of Listen and Spot (with no Wis bonus).

But Listen and Spot are considered class skills if you wanted to have some differently-built twig blights, Dungeonscape-style [see Dungeonscape page 103].

> All listed skills are class skills, unless the creature has a character class (noted in the entry). A creature's type and Intelligence score determine the number of skill points it has.
>
> --- <cite>Monster Manual, "Reading The Entries"</cite>

The number of skill points plants were given for 3.5 is "(2 + Int modifier, minimum 1) × (HD+3)". [Monster Manual, Chapter 5: Making Monsters, Table 5-4: Skill Points by Monster Type]

A twig blight has 4 skill points --- every non-mindless creature has the inalienable right to 4 skill points, no matter how low its Intelligence --- and it's buying Hide, Move Silently, Listen and Spot as class skills. The default twig blight has 1 rank in each. But it could have 4 ranks in Move Silently, or 2 ranks in each of Listen and Spot.

The Sunless Citadel doesn't do that, of course. There isn't any place it would be particularly appropriate to have a "sentinel" twig blight standing guard over the grove, so it works well to give all twig blights the same stats --- sinking one skill point into each of Hide and Move Silently, and taking the Stealthy feat on top of that, which together with their +1 Dex bonus makes +4 to Move Silently, and together with their +4 size bonus makes +8 to Hide. (Though, even in the original module, The Sunless Citadel provided a Hit Dice Advancement range for twig blights, in case you wanted to try something custom.)

> --- <cite>Monster Manual, page 290</cite>

We can use the nonelite array to make twig blights that have a bit more staying power, thanks to higher AC and HP, while being less deadly in their attacks.

```
Abilities: Str 9 - 2 = 7, Dex 13 + 2 = 15, Con 12 + 2 = 14, Int 11 - 6 = 5, Wis 10, Cha 8 - 6 = 2
Skills: Hide +7, Listen +1, Move Silently +3, Spot +4
Feats: Weapon Finesse
Hit Dice: 1d8+2 (6 hp)
Initiative: +2
AC: 16 (+1 size, +2 Dex, +3 natural)
Attacks: 2 claws +2 melee
Damage: Claw 1d3-2 plus poison (Fort DC 12, initial damage 1 Str)
Advancement: 2--3 HD (Small)
```

These twig blights cannot deal more than a single point of damage with each attack, so they're less likely to drop a character, but they're also less likely to go down without drawing blood, and they're more likely to deal at least one point of Strength damage. That makes them a little better as "introduction" twig blights, establishing the monster's key features.

This is the same principle as skipping the 60% roll for the first encounter: the first encounter is all about establishing their existence.

If we really wanted to give them some more staying power, we could bump these twig blights up to 2 Hit Dice (12hp), making them very unlikely to fall to a single blow. 3 Hit Dice would also give them another feat --- probably Ability Focus, to bump up their venom DC.
In that case, [the 1HD twig blights mass-grown in Belak's lab are stunted by comparison, and the PCs can cut through them like a scythe through wheat](https://allthetropes.fandom.com/wiki/Lowered_Monster_Difficulty) --- which works out, since by that point they're not scary monsters anymore, they're just dumb mooks for the real villain.

We could also give these twig blights a [major vampire bloodline](http://www.d20srd.org/srd/variant/races/bloodlines.htm#vampire) --- unlike the standard Monster Manual II twig blights, which are mostly born from other twig blights reproducing through their roots like aspen trees, these are the direct children of the Gulthias tree --- the blood has not yet run thin. That would give them a +2 bonus on Climb checks, so they can actually make a DC 10 Climb check, such as the one given for the upcoming cliff. 2HD twig blights would also get Stealthy as a bonus feat. (But 3HD twig blights wouldn't get a Strength bonus, since they cannot meet the qualifications.)
