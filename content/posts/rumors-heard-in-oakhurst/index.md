The Sunless Citadel provides half a dozen pieces of information that PCs can get their hands on through Gather Information.

Gather Information is a skill that's easily misunderstood. The name is vague --- Appraise, Decipher Script, Listen, Search, Sense Motive, and Spot all *gather information*, too. 4e's term, Streetwise, was more evocative, but Streetwise sounds like something that lets a character evade pursuit and things like that. Gather Information has a specifically narrow scope: finding people in town with useful information and getting that information out of them.

In a bit of questionable design, there's a lot of overlap between the Gather Information skill and the class-specific Bardic Knowledge mechanic. There is a distinction, but it's subtle. When a bard makes Bardic Knowledge checks, they're not actually going out and doing anything --- the check is made in an instant, to determine whether they've *already* gathered the information. Gather Information is something you *do*; a bard is something you *are*. A bard is assumed to be gathering information *all the time* --- that's part of what it means to be a bard.

A Gather Information check is done on-screen, unlike how a bard's knowledge is gathered off-screen.

> A typical Gather Information check takes 1d4+1 hours.

> --- <cite>Player's Handbook, Chapter 4: Skills</cite>

That is, even taking 10 on the Gather Information check itself, a character doesn't know exactly how long they need to troll for rumors before finding anything. After two hours, if they find nothing, it could mean that they rolled a 1 on the d4 and failed the Gather Information check (or that there's nothing more to find about the topic they're looking for). Or it could mean they rolled a 4 on the d4 and need to keep going three more hours. Usually, of course, they won't be under so much time pressure that this really matters.

But just because a Gather Information check happens on-screen doesn't mean a Gather Information check is very similar to the likes of Listen, Search, Sense Motive, and Spot.

Skills like Listen (hear something), Search (find something in a space max 10 feet on a side), and Spot (see something) have small chunks; skills like Handle Animal to train an animal, Heal to provide long-term care to a patient, Craft and Profession all have much, much bigger chunks. Gather Information is more like the latter.
A Gather Information check doesn't take days or weeks, but it does take hours. A "typical" Gather Information check takes 1d4+1 hours.[Player's Handbook page 74] A Search check takes six seconds; there is no analogue to the Search skill with larger chunks, for finding treasure in an entire dungeon complex.

If everyone in the party makes Gather Information checks at the same time, it can look like [an investigative montage](https://thealexandrian.net/wordpress/44117/roleplaying-games/scenario-structure-challenge-5-the-rpg-montage).

A higher levels, a Gather Information check includes such things as minor disguises and bluffs to gather someone's trash without arousing suspicion, much like how a Heal check includes spotting discoloration, a Handle Animal check includes sensing motives, and a Profession (innkeeper) check includes diplomacy. The character might or might not be any good at those things outisde of their comfort zone, but when they're in their element, they're very effective.

You don't target Gather Information at a particular NPC in front of you --- you target a kind of information. Quite often, the character has only the vaguest idea of what information they're looking for. But nevertheless, they expect to find *something*.

A module should provide DCs for Decipher Script, Listen, Search, and Spot where appropriate. But it's not a disaster to forget to include some --- they can usually be inferred from context. The module will obviously always say (if only implicitly) what is there to read, hear, or see if there is something. Appraise and Sense Motive DCs can almost always be inferred from context, though it's good practice to note them inline if they're particularly important.

Gather Information, however, like the Knowledge skills, requires special handling. When these skills are used, the player often doesn't know what they're looking for. This is also true for Decipher Script and Sense Motive, but hopefully if a module includes a mysterious scroll or a lying NPC, it includes what the book is about and what the NPC is lying about! And of course you roll Listen and Spot checks because you know there's something the PCs might hear or see.

Of course, there is a general direction the player is interested in. The canonical use of Knowledge skills is to get useful information about a monster in front of you. Similarly, Gather Information is most commonly used to get useful information about a dungeon the party is about to delve, or otherwise about the adventure.

The Gather Information section in this module is...very minimalist. The way you'll usually start to plan out a Gather Information section is to make a list of what information is available. And explicitly including this list in a written module is a very good idea. We don't just want to include tearful farmers in a scene; we want to be very clear on why they're there.

> The form of the information is just the interactive thingy you hide the information behind. It can be a dead body the players examine, it can be an interaction with an NPC, a book, a library, an oracle, an ancient tablet, six hours of alchemical experiments on a vial of poison to discover its origins, a contact other plane spell, whatever. The important part is the information itself. How you hide it in the world is secondary.
>
> However, it IS important to be clear and unambiguous. Unless you mean to make the information a challenge (like a cryptic riddle), don't be afraid to tell the players flat-out exactly what you want them to know. Don't be afraid to break character. To switch from "aye, I have a lot of experience with orcs, let me tell ya" to "the old soldier explains that orcs are savage, bestial humanoids who live by raiding and pillaging the civilized races..." It is important to be as clear as possible.
>
> the moment you allow the players to interact with the world, you're going to have to improvise. If the PCs are examining a dead body, looking for clues, they might not ask any of the questions you expected and they might ask a whole bunch of questions you didn't. That's why it is extremely important to think FIRST about the information you want to impart and SECOND about the form it takes. If the PCs ask clever questions that aren't the questions you expected, you can give them the same information you had planned on, just give it to them in different ways.
>
> When you get good at this, though, it allows you to disguise exposition as exploration. That is to say, you can make an exposition scene seem interactive by letting the players ask questions and making sure that you give all the information you want to give in that scene in response to their questions. And if anything gets missed, you can always use the "oh, one more thing" approach. That's where, just as the scene is about to end, the NPC suddenly says "oh, one more thing that might be useful..." and includes the thing they didn't think to ask.
>
> Alternatively, if the players are wandering out of a scene and there's still information you NEED to hand them, you can impart it as part of the "winding up and transitioning out narration." In that case, you briefly take control of the characters in a sneaky way to pass along some further information. When a player says "okay, I think we're done examining these ruins," you can narrate the "you finish up your exploration of the room, checking a few last things. In addition to what you already learned, you also find a small fragment of parchment that tells a little more about primordials. But there's nothing else of interest. From the parchment, you learn..."

The module has the list of information and...nothing else. No old soldiers, no tearful farmers. No [peasants](https://www.shamusyoung.com/twentysidedtale/?p=28980).
Still, this list of information is far better than nothing, and it's worth examining.

There are several pieces of information in the list. We can sort them out by categories, but before this can make any sense, we're going to have to define these categories.

- **Mandatory context**: Trade along the Old Road has dropped off due to Durbuluk banditry.
- **Context**: The Old Road skirts a lifeless ashen plain.
- **Foreshadowing**: The Sunless Citadel was a temple of a dragon cult.
- **Foreshadowing**: The ashen plain is the result of a rampage by a dragon.
- **Context** that very unfortunately looks like **actionable information**: Cattle and people have been killed by mysterious attacks.
- **Context** that very unfortunately looks like **actionable information**: Attacks on cattle and people occur only at night.
- **Context** that very unfortunately looks like **actionable information**: Corpses of cattle and people show marks from dozens of needlelike claws.
- **Context**: Talgen and Sharwyn Hucrele were traveling with two men named Karakas and Sir Braford.
- **Context**: Talgen Hucrele was a fighter. Sharwyn Hucrele is a wizard. Sir Braford is a paladin of Pelor. Karakas was a ranger.
- **Context**: Sir Braford was not a local.
- **Actionable information**: Sir Braford had a magic sword called Shatterspike.
- **Context**: Each winter, the goblins auction a poisonous apple.
- **Actionable information**: A man named Belak asked questions about the Sunless Citadel thirteen years ago.
- **Actionable information**: Belak had a very large pet tree frog.

First, there's the **actionable** information the characters want in-universe. This information might be critical (like the location of the Sunless Citadel itself) or it might be only minorly useful (like the fact that Rodents Of Unusual Size infest the rubble field around the Citadel).

As you know if you followed the link above, the Angry GM thinks it's worth splitting this into "objective" information and "helpful" information. I disagree, but talking about why we disagree is a good way to clarify what "actionable information" means.

> Next, there's objective information. This is information that represents the objective of the adventure or the means to accomplish it. For example, the identity of the killer in a murder mystery is an objective. The location of the hidden shrine that the PCs have to discover through exploration? That's objective information. Without objective information, the PCs can participate in the adventure, but ultimately, they can't succeed. Without it, they fail at their goals.
>
> --- <cite>[The Angry GM, "Information Management"](https://theangrygm.com/exploration-and-information-management/)</cite>

That sounds nice and all, but in practice there's a sliding scale of actionable information --- some data are more actionable than others, but wherever you decide to draw a dividing line between "objective" information and merely "helpful" information, it's going to be arbitrary.

For example: in the Sunless Citadel, there's a magical door sealed by a riddle. This is a side-trek that has nothing to do with the main adventure, but for the sake of this discussion, assume that the tomb behind that riddle-door is the objective. So the answer to the riddle is "objective" information, right? But...the players could also get into the tomb by breaking through the wall. Sure, that's not the most likely route, nor is it the easiest. But it's possible.

Inside the tomb, there is a troll. The troll can only be killed by fire or acid. So the troll's weaknesses are "objective" information, right? But...they don't really have to kill the troll. They could lure it out and trap it somewhere. Or just distract it. Or stealth past it somehow.

Even the identity of a serial killer isn't really "objective" information. Maybe the players don't figure out *who* the killer is, but do figure out *why* they're killing, and research the relevant Elder Evil, and successfully predict where the killer is going to strike next through a combination of intelligence, luck, and divination magic. That's enough to lay a trap and catch the killer that way, without needing to hunt down the killer at home.

Sure, you could craft a bulletproof category of "objective" information with clear boundaries, but then it would be so small as to be useless. And with a fuzzy boundary, pretty much any guideline for how to handle "objective" information would also apply to "helpful" information, and vice versa.

So "actionable" information is really a sliding scale to the second category.

The second category is **context**.
Context is information that the PCs can't act on. (As far as you can anticipate. Obviously players can surprise you.)
Often, the player *characters* don't even want or care about context. Context is for the *players*.

Context is information like the fact that Sharwyn Hucrele struggled with alcoholism. She was sober six months before falling off the wagon. She went after the apple in the desperate hope of a cure.
The PCs don't need to know that. But it humanizes Sharwyn. It makes the world and the characters feel more real.

It's like the wizards in Harry Potter playing the card game Exploding Snap. It's an attempt to convince the reader that these are real people, that they have lives outside of the plot, that their deaths matter. Because it will never be relevant to the plot, it can be vague on pertinent details. J.K. Rowling never defines the rules of Exploding Snap. (Unless she does, in which case assume for the sake of argument that she doesn't.) What matters is that it exists and how people feel about playing it: it's a pastime, played by several people. It's not Serious Business like Quidditch. It's something characters do to unwind.

Either actionable information or context can be **mandatory**. Mandatory information is required because without it, there is no story.

Kerowyn Hucrele's job ad is mandatory actionable information, unless we come up with an alternative character hook. (There are two possibilities in the list of rumors, though the module didn't think them worth promoting into the Hooks section.)

[We earlier argued that the history between the Durbuluks and Oakhurst is mandatory context.](/sunless-citadel-adventure-synopsis#durbuluks-raided-road) It's clearly not actionable, but without it, the players won't feel what we need them to feel.

Mandatory information always becomes mandatory at some particular time. If information becomes mandatory at the end of the adventure, but not before, then we could certainly say that that information is the party's objective.
[Mandatory information is an example of what The Alexandrian calls a chokepoint problem.](https://thealexandrian.net/wordpress/1118/roleplaying-games/three-clue-rule)
Fortunately, right now we're only interested in Gather Information gathering rumors and we don't have to think about temporal considerations and revelations.
The context that the Durbuluks raided commerce only becomes mandatory when the players start fighting the Durbuluks, but they're going to start fighting the Durbuluks as soon as they *meet* the Durbuluks, so effectively it's mandatory right away.

Actionable information that *isn't* mandatory can be thought of as "reward" information. If you invest resources into gathering information --- time, money, skill points, spells, whatever --- you get something that will take a bit of pressure off your *other* adventuring resources.

Third, there's **foreshadowing** information. Foreshadowing information is information whose significance isn't immediately obvious. Foreshadowing information is destined to become either actionable information or context. Simply by existing, foreshadowing information foreshadows that "something is going to happen to make this significant in retrospect."

Players might go looking for context, if they're invested in the story; they really *can't* go looking for foreshadowing information, even if they wanted to.

A Gather Information check is a uniquely broad, shallow source of information. Whatever the players need to find out, there's almost always *some* piece of it or *some* clue that someone in the community might plausibly know. On the flip side, if the PCs ask probing questions, the NPC might simply shrug it off with "I don't know."
Thanks to this, a Gather Information check is a great opportunity to give some context and foreshadowing information. Just be sure to cough up actionable information too --- [that's what gives them an excuse to keep coming back](https://www.shamusyoung.com/twentysidedtale/?p=28980).

Sometimes foreshadowing information even gets smuggled in with a crate of context, and initially appears to just be some low-quality context.

> The Old Road skirts the Ashen Plain, a lifeless land. Player characters who succeed at a Knowledge check (history, geography, or local, DC 12), or ask someone in Oakhurst, know that the desolation is attributed to the ancient rampage of a dragon named Ashardalon.
>
> --- <cite>The Sunless Citadel, "Rumors heard in Oakhurst"</cite>

The context here is the Ashen Plain. The party will *see* the Ashen Plain as they walk along the Old Road to the Sunless Citadel, and this gives them context for how Oakhurst feels about it. It's not just a big empty space --- it's the ruined remnant of a long-past disaster. It makes the world feel older, which helps when we want the forthcoming dungeon to feel palpably old. The disaster that scorched the Ashen Plain provides a counterpart to the disaster that buried the Sunless Citadel. This helps to get across that whatever buried the Citadel isn't important to the plot --- detritus from the Time of Myths is just scattered around here. People just live with it.

But in contrast to the unspecified disaster that buried the Citadel, the Ashen Plain fell victim to a rather more *specified* disaster, including a proper noun. And most people will just shrug that off. Yeah, yeah, Ashurbanipal, whatever.

> ...this sort of thing is so commonly tiresome in fantasy. An author creates a convoluted narrative of gods and wars and legends and thinks the reader will find it as interesting as they do, if only they relay every detail *precisely*.

>
> --- <cite>[Rutskarn](https://www.shamusyoung.com/twentysidedtale/?p=28833)</cite>

But in fact this is foreshadowing --- for a later adventure in the same series. The PCs are intended to eventually fight Ashardalon, and this will become context for why Ashardalon is a seriously bad guy they should want to fight.
I am not a fan of the later adventures in this series; fortunately, The Sunless Citadel stands well enough on its own. If you don't plan to use the rest of the series, this foreshadowing can be simply deleted.

(It might be worth keeping if it helped to make the world feel more immersive, but without some kind of explanation of the mechanics of dracogenic desertification, it just sounds odd. A really big fire wouldn't prevent anything from growing there ever again; quite the contrary, ash fertilizes the ground.)


Now, with all that in mind, the other rumors.

> The missing adventurers include a fighter (Talgen), a wizard (Sharwyn), a paladin of Pelor (Sir Braford), and a ranger (Karakas). Sir Braford was not a local, and he had a magic sword called Shatterspike.
>
> --- <cite>The Sunless Citadel, "Rumors heard in Oakhurst"</cite>

Noticeable how Sir Braford gets sixteen words to Karakas' two. (Eighteen words, in fact, if you count the fact that Braford gets a Sir in front of his name.) Karakas is simply "a ranger", but Sir Braford gets his god specified with "a paladin of Pelor" and he "was not a local, and he had a magic sword called Shatterspike." That must've been *some* sword for people to remember its *name*. I guess it glowed?

The mention of Karakas is valuable context, because the party is going to find his corpse later. All the information on Sir Braford is a bit of a headscratcher. Sir Braford gets a bunch of extra information, none of which humanizes him and none of which will ever really be actionable. (Unless the PCs guess Shatterspike's magic powers from the name, I suppose.)

It doesn't consume a lot of ink, but it does consume a lot of player headspace. Sir Braford *sounds important*.

Karakas is a ranger (one).

Sir Braford is a paladin (one) of Pelor (two) who is not a local (three) and who has a magic sword called Shatterspike (four). Five if you count the "Sir". Sir Braford sounds important. He even sounds like he would be important in-universe. Is somebody looking for this guy? Somebody is looking for the Hucreles, that's for sure. Isn't he a knight of someplace? Especially given that he's "not a local"...

As it stands, it walks like foreshadowing and it quacks like foreshadowing...but it's not foreshadowing. None of this will ever become significant later. What gives?

I think this was originally intended to be foreshadowing for the very next adventure in the series, The Forge of Fury.

> Examining the story feels like an archaeological dig where we try to figure out what era the disparate pieces belong to.

> --- <cite>[Thief Autopsy](http://www.shamusyoung.com/twentysidedtale/?p=22587)</cite>

The one clear reference to The Forge of Fury in The Sunless Citadel is

> a sealed scroll case carved of bone, carrying an inscription. Runes in the Dwarven alphabet spell out the word Khundrukar (translation: the Glitterhame). An old (about one hundred years) crumbling parchment lies within. Age and water damage have destroyed most of the parchment, but a short message in Dwarven remains: ". . . the remaining few. By order of Durgeddin the Black, we have created a secret dwarven redoubt. None shall find us; however,..."
>
> --- <cite>The Sunless Citadel, page 21</cite>

The goblins just...randomly have this in their trophy room. There's nothing the PCs can apparently do with it, except sell it to historically-minded dwarves for 100 gp.

I'm guessing that originally Sir Braford was supposed to be a knight in the service of Baron Althon, the client in that next adventure, who's looking for the Glitterhame. Sir Braford was supposed to be bringing the parchment and the sword (which was forged by Durgeddin the Black) to Baron Althon, but he got mixed up in the war against the Durbuluks, because paladins gotta paladin. The goblins took the parchment (which may originally have been a *map*) from him when they captured him. Since Baron Althon is not local, he was delayed in hearing about the loss of his knight, and so he (conveniently) won't come looking for knight, sword or parchment until right after the end of this current adventure.

But pretty much all connection between The Sunless Citadel and The Forge of Fury has been scrubbed, and I can't really say it was the wrong decision. There's no real *thematic* connection between the two adventures; they don't *feel* like two parts of the same story. Might as well make the two modules *modular*.

> The Old Road ran right past the nearby ruins (the Sunless Citadel), but fell into disuse because of goblin banditry. No one knows for sure what the Sunless Citadel once was, but old legends hint that it served as the retreat of an ancient dragon cult.
>
> --- <cite>The Sunless Citadel, "Rumors heard in Oakhurst"</cite>

The mention of the ancient dragon cult work as foreshadowing of the non-ancient dragon cult come to claim their inheritance. The mentions of goblin banditry sound like they were meant to be foreshadowing of the goblin bandits, but [as we talked about before, the Oakhurstians darn well ought to just know that the goblins are laired in the Citadel](/sunless-citadel-character-hooks-rescue-mission#oakhurstians-know-durbuluks-in-citadel). (Especially since the PCs are going to find the Durbuluks' gang tags outside the place.) And vagueness aside, [goblin banditry is mandatory context](/sunless-citadel-adventure-synopsis#durbuluks-raided-road), so it shouldn't be gated behind a Gather Information check.

The 5e update of The Sunless Citadel resolves my objection to mandatory context being gated behind a Gather Information check...in much the same way that PCs might solve the problem of a serial killer by massacring every man, woman and child in the city, thus guaranteeing that they got the killer.

In the 5e update, there is no mention of goblin banditry anywhere in Oakhurst. The only way for the PCs to learn about it is *after* attacking, such as by capturing and interrogating the goblins.

The main villain also gets a bit of foreshadowing here:

> Garon, the barkeep of the Ol' Boar Inn, remembers the last time anyone, aside from Talgen and Sharwyn, asked questions about the Sunless Citadel. About thirteen years ago, a grim man named Belak stopped by, and he had a very large pet tree frog.
>
> --- <cite>The Sunless Citadel, "Rumors heard in Oakhurst"</cite>

This is the only rumor attached to an actual person you can talk to. So that's nice. And foreshadowing the eventual main villain is all to the good.

This is a perfect opportunity for [The AngryGM's "oh, one more thing" technique](https://theangrygm.com/exploration-and-information-management/). Just as the party is leaving, the barkeep mentions "You lot ask a lot of question...I remember the last time someone asked questions..."

Having said that, the timeline makes this conceit really, really stupid. Nobody else was interested in the Citadel for *thirteen years*? As we just reiterated, the Oakhurstians have to know the goblins are in the Citadel. *That* was never a topic of conversation?

(In fairness, the module will eventually get around to mentioning that the "goblin banditry" mentioned in the other rumor happened *forty years ago*. So everyone has pretty much *forgotten* that the goblins are there. Because that's how banditry works, right? You bandit until trade drops off, and then instead of raiding the locals you just keep your head down and get by with no source of income for decades. And the locals pretty much forget about you, but the merchants obviously *don't* forget about you, because *banditry is the reason there's no trade along the Old Road*...yeah, we will have *words* about this when we get to the goblins.)

I think the obvious solution to Belak passing through such a long time ago (and other things) is to radically shorten the timeline of the adventure background --- but the timeline is woven into several events, not all of which we have talked about yet.
(Spoiler alert: the relevant events are goblin banditry, commerce along the Old Road dropping off, Belak learning of the Gulthias Tree, Belak taking possession of the Gulthias Tree, Belak learning the properties of the Gulthias Tree, the start of the apple auctions, the capture of a gnome, the kobolds learning of the lost temple, the kobolds arriving, and of course the lost adventurers setting out.)
All of these dates can be moved around, but some of them affect the others, so we'll talk about each as they become relevant, and at the end we'll see how we can shorten the entire timeline.

I will note briefly that we *could* better foreshadow the final villain by giving Belak more history with Oakhurst. Not necessarily anything elaborate, but something that would come up when following the trail of the Hucreles. Maybe Belak is known to live as a hermit in this area, with a little hut or something, and rumor has it they tried and failed to recruit him for the adventure. (Later it will become obvious that Belak then set an ambush for them; fortunately, Belak is now spending all his time underground fussing with his new supplicants, so the PCs have no opportunity to screw themselves over with a similar mistake.)

We could also soften the blow by saying there was someone else who Garon remembers asking about the Sunless Citadel --- an archaeologist interested in the temple. Not a kobold, probably, but someone who later bumped into the kobolds and served as *their* source of information. Not that the PCs could possibly anticipate that exact chain of events just from hearing about the archaeologist, but they can make the connection after the fact. It's more foreshadowing, and it makes the mention of Belak less obviously forced. Might be a little too complicated to bother with, though.

Notable by absence is any mention of [the vampire who used to haunt the Citadel after the time of the dragon cult but before the modern era, the vampire the Gulthias Tree grew from](/sunless-citadel-adventure-background). (Presumably the vampire was named Gulthias and that's why Belak calls it the Gulthias Tree, but the module never quite comes out and says so even to the DM.) This is probably for the best; [we don't want players to get the idea that they're going to run into a vampire when they aren't](http://elevenfootpole.blogspot.com/2009/05/foreshadowing-at-minotaur-gate.html).

There's also no "reward" information available for higher Gather Information results.

The average Oakhurstian probably doesn't know that Rodents Of Unusual Size lair in the ravine, because they don't spend a lot of time around the ravine, on account of the goblin graffiti warning them not to spend a lot of time around the ravine. But *someone* probably knows. That sounds like a DC 15 Gather Information check result.

We could also provide information about the Durbuluks...but that's tricky. Partly because the Durbuluk notables aren't described in enough detail to say what actionable information the Oakhurstians might have. We can maybe address that when we get to the Durbuluks --- figure out what deity Grenl worships and what spells she might commonly use, maybe split Durnn into a first-level hobgoblin barbarian and a third-level goblin warrior with distinct capabilities (so his famous temper can become actionable information), and of course Balsag is likely to stick in Oakhurstians' memories. But then we run into the problem that according to the official timeline, none of the Durbuluk notables had been born the last time the Durbuluks had contact with the Oakhurstians. Yeeaahh, we'll get to the timeline.

I've saved the most important foreshadowing for last: a pair of rumors with the same basic purpose: foreshadowing that there is something seriously wrong with the apple tree.

> Sometimes the goblins offer another apple at midwinter. This apple is corpse-white and utterly poisonous, even to the mere touch of the skin.
>
> --- <cite>The Sunless Citadel, "Rumors heard in Oakhurst"</cite>

Yes, it's a snow-white apple.

It's understandable that you have to poke around a bit to learn about the poison apples, since presumably those auctions are a lot more secretive. There's no point in buying poison if everyone knows you bought poison.
But it's worth noting that for some characters this could be a good character hook too. Maybe there was a murder, the murderer has already been caught but now you're investigating the murder weapon.

> Cattle herders don't graze their stock too far afield these days. They're frightened by stories of new monsters that maraud by night. No one has seen these creatures, nor do they leave a discernible trail; however, cattle and people who have been caught out alone have been found dead the next day, pierced by dozens of needlelike claws.

That isn't immediately obviously related to the fruit at all, but the clear intent is that the PCs will make the connection when they're attacked by twig blights on the road --- monsters made of wood with needlelike claws. That's the intent, but in the module as given it's unlikely that the PCs actually will be attacked on the road.

> Should the PCs travel or camp by night anywhere between Oakhurst and the Sunless Citadel, they stand a 60% chance per night of falling under attack by a pair of twig blights.

The ambush comes with some nicely evocative description provided:

> The twig blights attack under cover of night and from surrounding foliage (if any). They sound like wind blowing through dry leaves as they shuffle forward...
>
> If defeated, the blights appear to be loose bundles of snapped and broken twigs.
>
> --- <cite>The Sunless Citadel, page 4</cite>

Here's the thing: There's no reason for the PCs to travel or camp by night anywhere between Oakhurst and the Sunless Citadel.

### <a name="no-reason-to-walk-old-road-by-night"></a> Why would anyone travel by night?

> The distance between Oakhurst and the Sunless Citadel, via the Old Road, is seven miles. 140 minutes walking...
>
> It's a great idea for a first-level module to put the town so close to the dungeon to encourage players to retreat, rest and restock when they're running out of steam. First-level characters are fragile, and you can easily get a total party wipe if they try to push onward.
>
> Putting Oakhurst close enough to be easily reachable from the dungeon --- but far enough that it's still clearly separated from the Underworld --- encourages players to return to town to rest.
Assuming they don't dawdle, they can literally hike to the dungeon, do their adventuring, and hike back to town before nightfall, staying in town every night.

(And even if they do travel by night, there's only a 60% chance. I have no idea why they threw that 60% in there. There are circumstances in which it might be useful to explicitly let the players know that there's a 60% chance of random monster encounters so they can be forced to make choices e.g. whether to doff their armor for speed and take their chances on random encounters. But this is not one of those situations. The point of this encounter is to introduce the twig blights. I guess the 60% chance improves replay value, but the first time you run a given set of players through The Sunless Citadel you shouldn't be rolling for things like that. You can roll the next time.)

Is there a simple fix? Can we make the PCs travel by night?

Well. We certainly could. It would be easy --- but it would have trade-offs.

We could extend the distance between the town and the dungeon. Then PCs would have to travel by night to get to the dungeon. But then they wouldn't be able to easily return to town to rest.

We could arbitrarily say that the PCs receive their mission at night, and apply time pressure to make them want to get moving immediately. But time pressure means they won't want to return to town to rest midway through the dungeon. (Not to mention that applying time pressure would seem to mean emphasizing the need to rescue Kerowyn Hucrele's children, which will lead to disappointment since it's a shaggy-dog quest.)

Or --- we could give them *another* place to rest, between the town and the dungeon, somewhere that's secure against goblins but *not* secure against twig blights. But it's not obvious how to do that. Mechanically, goblins and twig blights are actually pretty similar: they're both Small and creep up by stealth.
Twig blights are immune to mind-affecting effects, sleep effects, poison, paralysis, and stunning --- but such exotica would be unlikely to protect a campsite without a very good explanation.

Put a pin in that. We may find a reason for characters to travel by night.




The mention that "No one has seen these creatures, nor do they leave a discernible trail" is notable. If they did leave a discernible trail, then they could be a plot hook in their own right --- get attacked by twig blights, Track them back to where the trail stops, which is where the saplings mysteriously disappeared that same night. Then *that* serves as the reason to investigate the goblins' fruit.

That wouldn't really work, though. If that's the hook, then the origin of the twig blights is mandatory information; gating mandatory information behind a Survival check and the Track feat is even worse than [gating mandatory context behind a Gather Information check](/sunless-citadel-adventure-synopsis#durbuluks-raided-road).

So why harp on this? Because it features prominently in the denouement.
Of the five paragraphs in the epilogue, three are devoted to warning people about the twig blights.

> If the PCs reveal the truth behind the fruit's seeds to the villagers of Oakhurst, the folk cut down and burn all growing saplings. You can allow the PCs to take part in the burning ceremony:
>
> As the villagers set the evil saplings alight, the mayor turns to you with a frank expression. "You realize that our actions have set loose several of these abominations upon the world. Who knows what these twisted plants are doing now?"
>
> Though the mayor does not know this, his words are hints at the truth of the situation. Twig blights already loose in the outer world can still reproduce via their roots, like aspen trees. If you want, you can allow the PCs to search out these twig blights and destroy them. Other options include spreading the word of the new creature to outlying areas or enlisting the help of the local rangers and druids to find and destroy the scourge of twisted plants. It is entirely up to you and your players where you go next. At any rate, if the player characters warn Oakhurst residents about the seeds, they have begun their first steps in gaining a measure of fame and establishing a rapport with local residents.

If the PCs didn't spend 1d4+1 hours and a few gold pieces trolling for rumors in a bar, then they'll have *no idea* that these attacks were even happening. If they even bother to mention the twig monsters to anyone in Oakhurst, they'll be wrong-footed that there was a whole other plot thread going on that they knew nothing about.
Sharing knowledge --- preferably in a parlor room --- can be a great payoff if it feels like the PCs *earned* the knowledge, but in this case they weren't even looking for answers about the monster attacks.

Even if the PCs *did* hear the rumors, they certainly didn't pursue the matter. That would have led them to the cattle ranches, not to the Sunless Citadel. If they *did* go to the cattle ranches, they would have met a frustrating dead end, since "No one has seen these creatures, nor do they leave a discernible trail."

Since we don't really get a payoff for the PCs learning the information anyway, we could say that Karakas already tracked the twig blights, and that it's now common knowledge in Oakhurst that planting the seeds results in monsters. That's simply part of the hook, the reason the PCs want to investigate the fruit.

That still doesn't give us a way to introduce the twig blights in suitably dramatic fashion, though. If they're going to be so important in the end, making them the first encounter would be a great idea. But that brings us back to the problem that the PCs have no reason to travel by night.

The night ambush definitely sounds promising. While fall is a more traditional time for sneaky twig monsters to attack, summer can work too. In summer, "the hills are lush with growth, though the heat sometimes grows oppressive." [Sunless Citadel page 4]

> A character in very hot conditions (above 90° F) must make a Fortitude saving throw each hour (DC 15, +1 for each previous check) or take 1d4 points of nonlethal damage. Characters wearing heavy clothing or armor of any sort take a -4 penalty on their saves.
A character who takes any nonlethal damage from heat exposure now suffers from heatstroke and is fatigued.

If we could get any characters to shed their armor, that would go a long way toward increasing the impact of the twig blight attack. Because they're designed to be potentially the first combat *ever*, the twig blights are actually very weak, but the *fear* doesn't depend on how dangerous the twig blights *really* are, it depends on how vulnerable the players feel.
(But that'll probably never happen. There are some things that real people do that PCs never do, and one of them is prioritizing comfort over paranoia. The players cam't actually feel how miserable the characters are, after all. And the expected extra nonlethal damage is only 4/20 \* (1 + 2 + 3 + 4)/4 = 1/5 \* 5/2 = 1/2 per hour.)

Winter, by contrast, would shut twig blights down cold...er, so to speak. Twig blights' main schtick is attacking from foliage, and deep snow tends to put the kibosh on that. If the PCs are after the winter fruit, we'll probably want to replace the twig blights wholesale with something else, like a pack of wolves driven to attack humans by an unholy scion. But for now we'll assume it's summer.

Heat could potentially provide a reason to travel by night --- if it's too hot to travel by daylight.
Pushing daytime temperatures above 110F, as in Sudan, would make daytime travel actually impossible. That would also make it implausible to have Oakhurst so nearby, but potentially we could run the Old Road straight through the Ashen Plain and play up the supernatural aspect. But really, this isn't necessary. Remember that the first time PCs travel to the dungeon, they'll be first-level characters. If they're on foot, they're facing two or three full hours before they get underground. The risk of 2d4 points of nonlethal damage is a serious threat --- that kind of damage would really hinder their expedition.

(Remember that there's no good reason to be cagey about basic rules like heat dangers --- that's just translating the characters' experience of their world into simplified game terms that the players can relate to their characters' statistics.)

Movement in darkness (or rather, *reduced visibility*, including fog and not including darkness if the entire party has darkvision) is at half speed [Player's Handbook Chapter 9: Adventuring] due to hardly being able to see your own feet.
(You can walk carefully, or endlessly stumble and occasionally fall on your face; either way, measured by the hour, your overland speed works out to half.)
If they travel by starlight (without a torch), then instead of potentially making the trip in 140 minutes, they're looking at 280 minutes. That still allows them to march to the Citadel, do some adventuring, and march back before dawn...but if anyone is carrying a medium load, or if there is, say, a dwarf in the party, then each way will take 420 minutes --- seven hours. So if they do want to avoid the heat of the day, they won't be able to return to Oakhurst the same night.

Of course, only the most paranoid would travel without a torch.
