That's good advice. But Standard Operating Procedure is more than marching order.

When walking, do the PCs keep their ranged weapons out, or their melee weapons? (Do the PCs atop the cliff already have ranged weapons out?)
Keeping no weapons out can be a good choice too --- if they keep ranged weapons in hand at all times, then getting melee weapons out requires two move actions (one to stow the ranged weapons) instead of one.

And then, of course, there's everything to do with stealth and detection --- highly relevant when twig blights are going to attack.

Stealth and detection revolves around the four skills Hide, Move Silently, Spot, and Listen.
The basic rule is trivial to remember: whenever someone tries to move silently, their Move Silently roll is opposed by the Listen roll of anyone who might hear them. You can probably guess from that how Hide and Spot interact.

The subtleties, however, can make it difficult for players to understand all the strategic options available to them. And often they do not need to. You can just assume the PCs travel at full speed. It doesn't really matter whether the twig blights surprise them or not. Either way the twig blights burst out of the foliage and engage them in combat.

But the twig blights make for a good working example for a simplified explanation of what goes into stealth and detection --- and the *next* encounter will be an ambush by dire rats where these rules *do* matter, and then they'll be mixed in with other rules that make things more complicated. Better to consider stealth and detection in the simpler overland case first.

Being stealthy and being watchful can both be improved by traveling slower, but in different ways.
Hide and Move Silently checks both take a numerical modifier based on how fast the character is moving. By contrast, Spot and Listen allow more or fewer rolls based on how fast the character is moving. [Player's Handbook Chapter 4: Skills] There are important differences in how those two mechanics operate: most importantly, a numerical modifier can change what is *possible*, while a reroll cannot. Anything that a character can Spot by taking extra time, they have a *chance* to Spot just with their one "free" Spot. If they had no chance in the first place --- we'll see a case of that when we get to the ravine --- then taking extra time won't help them.

(Fifth Edition calls rerolls "advantage" and replaced a ton of numerical modifiers with rerolls. Opinions...*vary* on whether this was a good idea.)

Hide and Move Silently assume the *default* case is that the character is moving as slowly as they need to --- so they take a *penalty* if they move faster than that. By contrast, Spot and Listen assume the *default* case is moving at full speed --- as, for example, a merchant caravan wouldn't be on maximum alert all the time --- so characters can get extra rolls by moving slower. [Skills]

Remember: Ten rounds equal one minute. (Sixty minutes equal one hour, in case you hadn't heard.)

> A character moving his or her speed twice in a single round, or moving that speed in the same round that he or she performs a standard action or another move action is hustling when he or she moves...A character can hustle for 1 hour without a problem. Hustling for a second hour in between sleep cycles deals 1 point of nonlethal damage, and each additional hour deals twice the damage taken during the previous hour of hustling. A character who takes any nonlethal damage from hustling becomes fatigued. A fatigued character can't run or charge and takes a penalty of -2 to Strength and Dexterity. Eliminating the nonlethal damage also eliminates the fatigue.

"Hustling" is an awkward attempt to conflate physical and mental effort to keep things *relatively* simple. The idea behind hustling is that no matter what speed you're moving at, you can double it (temporarily) by hustling.

Generally, when adventurers are actually in a dungeon, they're always assumed to be hustling --- taking two actions per round. But that heightened state of activity isn't sustainable over long journeys, not for first-level characters. *But*...it is absolutely possible for most first-level characters to hustle the entire distance from Oakhurst to the Citadel if they want to. They'll take a bit of nonlethal damage and fatigue, but they can choose to accept that.

By default, Hide and Spot are rolled on the hider's turn --- each time they take a move action, they roll a Hide check, and anyone who might see them gets an automatic Spot check. [Skills]
Thus, when sneaking up on a stationary target, it doesn't make any difference whether the sneaker hustles or not --- if they're covering, say, 15 feet with each move action, then they'll have to make a Hide check (and, more importantly, the target gets a Spot check) every 15 feet, regardless of whether they're taking one or two move actions per round.
And of course all the same for Move Silently and Listen. [Skills]

On the Spotter's turn, they can choose to spend a move action of their own on watchfulness. [Skills] That lets them roll a new Spot check against the last Hide roll of the hider. (If there *is* anyone hiding nearby. If there isn't, then obviously they're wasting their time.)
Alternatively, they can choose to spend a move action on Listening, opposed by the Move Silently roll of anyone who might be there. [Skills]

To Hide and/or Move Silently without penalty, the sneaker must move less than (or equal to) half of the full speed they *could* move at. [Skills] Moving at half speed in this way allows both hiding and moving silently --- the way you need to move, stepping gingerly and avoiding sudden movements, is pretty much the same in both cases. This moving at half speed can also overlap with a few obscure situations where deliberate movement avoids a penalty, such as picking one's way through a field of caltrops [Player's Handbook Chapter 7: Equipment], but not terrain that intrinsically hampers movement whether you like it or not, such as walking through foliage or up a slope, or when you can hardly see your own feet [Player's Handbook Chapter 9: Adventuring].

When figuring the party's overland speed, the first step is to figure each character's individual speed.

Character speed depends on how much weight they're carrying. [see Player's Handbook Chapter 9: Adventuring] If someone is slowed down by the weight of gear, that can sometimes be alleviated by redistributing weight according to character strength. But there's no interesting *choice* happening there --- indeed, it's usually best to just total up the weight of *all* the gear, total up all character's pound limits for a light load, and see whether *someone* is going to have to be slowed down by encumbrance. And then just don't worry about exactly who is carrying the rope or all the trail rations.

Since the party is presumably going to travel together at the same speed, without splitting up, each party member picks a strategy in the same speed band.
For example, if one character has speed 20 feet, the entire party might move at 2 miles per hour, and the three party members with speed 30 feet each make an extra Spot checks every three rounds (so in each round, *someone* is making an extra Spot check).

All these speeds might be cut in half if the party goes over rough terrain --- for example, if they decide to abandon the road for whatever reason. But because that applies equally to all party members, the strategic trade-offs remain the same.

6 miles per hour:
* Speed 30feet, hustling with no caution.

4 miles per hour:
* Speed 20feet, hustling with no caution.

3 miles per hour:
* Speed 30feet, walking.
* Speed 30feet, hustling, extra Spot every round.
* Speed 30feet, hustling, extra Listen every round.
* Speed 30feet, hustling, half speed for stealth.
* Speed 30feet, hustling, in subjective darkness.
* Speed 20feet, hustling, extra Spot every two rounds.

2 miles per hour:
* Speed 20feet, walking.
* Speed 20feet, hustling, extra Spot every round.
* Speed 20feet, hustling, extra Listen every round.
* Speed 20feet, hustling, half speed for stealth.
* Speed 30feet, walking, extra Spot every three rounds.
* Speed 30feet, walking, extra Listen every three rounds.

1.5 miles per hour:
* Speed 30feet, walking, extra Spot every round.
* Speed 30feet, walking, extra Listen every round.
* Speed 30feet, walking, half speed for stealth.
* Speed 30feet, walking, in subjective darkness.
* Speed 30feet, hustling, half speed for stealth, extra Spot every round.
* Speed 30feet, hustling, half speed for stealth, extra Listen every round.
* Speed 30feet, hustling, extra Spot every round, extra Listen every two rounds.
* Speed 30feet, hustling, extra Listen every round, extra Spot every two rounds.
* Speed 30feet, hustling, three extra Spot checks every two rounds.
* Speed 30feet, hustling, three extra Listen checks every two rounds.
* Speed 20feet, walking, extra Spot every four rounds.
* Speed 20feet, walking, extra Listen every four rounds.
* Et cetera ad infinitum.

If the characters aren't under time pressure, they can travel as slowly as they want. If they want, every time they take a step, they can pause for a minute to make twenty Spot checks. Of course eventually they'll have to rest. And eat. And drink. And if they're worried about the heat of the day, eventually the sun will come up.

There are as many different combinations of strategies as there are different party combinations. For example, a party of three humans and one dwarf might choose to forego a torch in favor of letting the dwarf lead the way --- everyone else would travel at half speed due to not being able to see, while the dwarf would take an extra Spot check every four rounds.

Of course, in order to even attempt to Hide, a creature needs some form of cover or concealment, such as foliage or darkness.

Depending on weather, we could have four ambient light conditions:

* Humans and halflings cannot see anything, neither can characters with low-light vision.
* Humans and halflings cannot see anything, characters with low-light vision see shadowy illumination.
* Humans and halflings see shadowy illumination, so do characters with low-light vision.
* Humans and halflings see shadowy illumination, characters with low-light vision see as well as if it were daylight.

Shadowy illumination provides concealment, enabling Hide checks and also giving all attacks a flat 20% chance to miss. (This isn't the same as a -4 penalty to attack rolls; if you can't clearly *see* the target, there's a 20% chance you aim at the wrong place and miss cleanly, even if the target is unarmored and *unconscious*.)

In the last case, characters with low-light vision can move at full speed, just like characters with darkvision, and twig blights cannot hide without something to hide behind (but twig blights would probably hide in foliage anyway).

If the night is darker so that creatures with low-light vision see shadowy illumination, then it's actually possible for the PCs to hide from the twig blights, even walking along the road with no cover.

We will assume, though, that we're in that last case: humans and halflings see shadowy illumination, characters with low-light vision see as well as if it were daylight. It's a bright moonlit night.

What we haven't talked about, though, is when to *start* rolling stealth versus detection checks.

You need some form of cover or concealment to hide at all, but *total* cover or *total* concealment make a Hide check unnecessary --- no matter how good Legolas's elf-eyes are, he doesn't have x-ray vision. In an environment with a whole lot of random minor obstructions, such as a forest, eventually they all overlap so that you have no line of sight beyond a certain distance.

What distance? The Dungeon Master's Guide gives guidelines for when the party is in an unmapped forest. If the party looks in any given direction, their line of sight stops at 3d6 x 10 feet (in a sparse forest) [Dungeon Master's Guide page 87]. You roll randomly. Of course, for an emplaced encounter, you can figure out how far you want the line of sight to be, just as, in a fully-mapped dungeon, you can figure out exactly where line-of-sight reaches just by drawing lines.

The DMG also has guidelines for line-of-sight in hill country like the "rocky downs" the Old Road winds through --- sometimes the elevation changes obstruct line of sight, and you randomly roll for that, which thereby determines where the party happens to be in the ups and downs at that moment.

But the terrain guidelines can't cover every situation; in particular, in this case we have a mix of terrain types. We have a broad road, going through hills, occasionally "near stands of old-growth oak" [The Sunless Citadel, page 4].

For convenience, we can just declare that line-of-sight *just so happens* to become possible right when it becomes possible for a Listen check to succeed on a roll of 20. That will be...uh. What are the twig blights' skills? That's a surprisingly complicated question.
