What do the various prices actually mean in-universe? If a flint-and-steel set costs 1 gold piece...how do normal people think about items of that value?

We want to know for one minor reason and one major reason. First, PCs might have once *been* normal people. But more importantly, low-level PCs spend a lot of time *interacting* with normal people.

First, let us define our aims. We are not going to try to model an entire economy. We only care about the visible pieces. We only care about the sorts of products that PCs interact with.

When prices are specified, a single word doesn't capture the full range of things you might actually be buying. A candle, a mirror, a tent, a torch --- each of those words encompasses a very wide range.

In the case of candles and torches, the most relevant details are specified. A torch weighs one pound, can be held in one hand, and lasts one hour, so we're not talking about a banquet torch with the weight and handling characteristics of a quarterstaff that burns all evening. A "typical" torch is tallow; the candle, by contrast, is unspecified, though it's *probably* beeswax, not tallow.

For a mirror, or a tent, or a fire-steel, the common-sense answer is that the kind of item the price is listed for is whichever kind of item an adventurer *would in fact* buy.

You could buy a very shoddy fire-steel that might break unexpectedly. You could buy an ornamented fire-steel for showing off wealth. A village-dweller might have opportunities to use a fire-steel in front of company in his longhouse, but an adventurer would typically be using a fire-steel alone in the wilderness, often in secret. So an adventurer has little use for using a fire-steel to show off wealth; when they're in town, they're more likely to just pay someone for lodging, and thus won't even by making their own fire at all.



> When economists try to compare our material standard of living with that of our predecessors, they have to calculate the extent to which prices have changed. A dollar in 1900 bought more than a dollar today-but how much more? It's an impossible comparison, because we don't spend our money on the same things as we did in 1900. For example, if you flip through the old Montgomery Ward mail-order catalog, you'll discover that a bicycle cost 260 hours' wages for the typical worker in the late nineteenth century, but just 7.2 hours' wages in 2000. But silver spoons actually cost more hours of labor today than in 1900. Which inflation rate should you use? It depends on whether you are buying bicycles or spoons.

> What about Roman oil lamps? Nordhaus bought one - alleged to be a genuine antique - and rigged it up with a wick. He filled it with cold-pressed sesame oil. Twenty pounds of logs burned for a little more than three hours, but an eggcup of oil burned all day, more brightly and far more controllably. This was a sensational improvement, if nothing compared with the lightbulb and the LED.
