We'll start with the material given to players, and then discuss the expected later effects beyond what we want to say to players up front.

### For Players

A character could be hoping to have a phobia cured. Remember that a phobia is an extreme and *irrational* fear. The character consciously thinks of it as a mental illness and wants to be rid of it.

> When a character with a mild phobia encounters the object of her phobia, she must make a successful Will save or become shaken. The DC of the save equals 12 + the CR of the challenge that is the object of the phobia. (Treat CRs of less than 1 as 0.)
> A moderate phobia requires the character to succeed on a Will save (DC 14 + the CR of the challenge) or become frightened.
> A severe phobia requires the character to succeed on a Will save (DC 16 + the CR of the challenge) or become panicked.
>
> --- <cite>Heroes of Horror, page 61</cite>

> A frightened creature flees from the source of its fear as best it can. If unable to flee, it may fight. A frightened creature can use special abilities, including spells, to flee; indeed, the creature must use such means if they are the only way to escape.
>
> --- <cite>Player's Handbook page 309</cite>

> A panicked creature must drop anything it holds and flee at top speed from the source of its fear, as well as any other dangers it encounters, along a random path. If cornered, a panicked creature cowers. A panicked creature can use special abilities, including spells, to flee; indeed, the creature must use such means if they are the only way to escape.

> --- <cite>Player's Handbook page 311</cite>

> The normal rules for stacking fear effects apply to phobias as well. If a character becomes shaken from exposure to an object of her phobia, a second exposure to a different object while she is still shaken makes her frightened. An encounter with a group of creatures of the same kind counts as a single exposure, even if more creatures of the same kind appear in the middle of the encounter. However, if a character with a phobia about vermin is fighting a group of monstrous centipedes when a monstrous spider suddenly appears, this different type of vermin counts as a second exposure to a different object.

As you can tell, Heroes of Horror is mostly focused on phobias of creatures, but there are other phobias on offer. The standout is acrophobia:

> This phobia applies when the character is moving vertically (climbing, flying, falling, and so on), or near a sudden drop (clifftops, bridges, stairs, pit traps, and the like), or in any other situation where falling damage is possible.

Since heights don't have CRs, the Will save DC increases by 1 per 20 feet of height of the relevant fall.

Still, some of the creature types might be good choices too.

One key to remember when talking about fear of, say, dragons, is that this is an *irrational* fear. This isn't Indiana Jones' fear of snakes. The character *knows* that their fear is irrational and specifically wants to be rid of it for good; that's why they're after the apple.

Magitherophobia --- fear of magical beasts (from Greek magikos "magical" and ther "wild beast" --- includes the familiars of wizards and sorcerers. It can be a fun choice if there's a wizard or sorcerer in the party. Otherwise, skip it --- it won't be particularly interesting.

Physiphobia --- fear of elementals and fey (from Greek physika, "natural things") --- might be appropriate for a character who sees themselves as "unnatural" in some way. There may be some encounters with them, but I'll tell you right now that running away wouldn't be a disaster in any of those cases.

Dracophobia will make for some interesting roleplaying opportunities when exploring an ancient dragon temple. (minor spoiler) <span style="color:#000000;background-color:#000000;">It won't be too much of a pain in gameplay, because there are no unavoidable dragon fights in this adventure.</span>

Xenophobia --- fear of [outsiders](http://www.d20srd.org/srd/typesSubtypes.htm#outsiderType) --- could be related to fear of the afterlife, fear of deities, or something else. Be warned that while there are no unavoidable encounters with outsiders, you might encounter outsiders unexpectedly --- they can be sneaky little blighters. You might, at one point, abandon your party members to a somewhat-tough fight. Also note that if you're picturing a character's mind having been shattered by a prior encounter with a horrorterror from Beyond, you probably want a Form of Madness instead.

Necrophobia...oof. You can manage with it, if you slow down a bit and cast Detect Undead or Detect Evil at suspicious doors. Necrophobia would definitely be a challenge to play with, but you *can* mostly avoid undead if you make a point of trying. You don't have to worry about being forced to march into a major undead encounter to reach the end of the adventure, and then being forced to flee and leave your party members to fight without you.

### For DMs

The great thing about acrophobia for this dungeon is that it applies exactly to dramatic moments but *not* to major fight scenes.

Acrophobia will be triggered when first approaching the cliff to climb down to the Citadel...and it may take a few tries to overcome the character's fear, but they'll succeed eventually.

Acrophobia will be triggered when climbing down to the second level after defeating the goblin chief...and again, the character can keep trying until they manage it.

A character might also run away from pit traps; this could be played for comic relief if you want.

> A player...can choose any of the following creature types as the object of a character's phobia: aberrations, animals, constructs, dragons, elementals and fey, giants and monstrous humanoids, magical beasts, oozes and vermin, outsiders, plants, or undead.

> --- <cite>Heroes of Horror, page 62</cite>

There are no aberrations, constructs, giants, monstrous humanoids, oozes, or vermin in this adventure.
No magical beasts either --- there's a wizard and a sorcerer, but neither has a familiar, presumably because they don't have enough money.

Later in the dungeon there are a couple of optional fights with thoqquas, wormlike fire/earth elementals. If a character has physiphobia, we can do a little more with them, saying perhaps that's they were subconsciously drawn and enraged by nature's rejection of and need to destroy the unnatural Gulthias Tree. But the real payoff to physiphobia is fey. There are no fey in this adventure, but there might appear to be --- Sharwyn Hucrele has barklike skin and can cast both Sleep and Charm Person, so she could pull off a fair imitation of a dryad.

Dracophobia will certainly make for an interesting conflict with the kobold dragon cult. It'll severely complicate any attempt to recapture the wyrmling, but as we'll discuss, recapturing the wyrmling is really not necessary at all.

There are two outsiders, a water mephit and a quasit. Both are completely skippable, but both pop out unexpectedly.

The undead go back to the division we talked about between the ancient Citadel itself and the current squatters. Players don't *have* to go tomb-raiding, and the module maintains a separation between the kinds of monsters players encounter while pursuing their current goals versus challenging the unknown, which has the advantage of giving the tomb-raiding parts a very different game-feel from the war of attrition against the goblins.

Well...mostly. There is one undead encounter in the mainline quest, in Area 42. I have issues with it. There's not necessarily a problem with mixing and matching the themes --- after establishing that the undead exist and that Belak's faction exists, we can show Belak's faction using the undead for their own ends. But it doesn't come off very well. We'll get there later.

Botanophobia would probably be a poor choice. We are going to try to make the player actually afraid of plants, and mixing that with an imaginary character's irrational fear would be counterproductive. Nothing is less scary than being told "you're afraid."

Zoophobia would be a poor choice, mainly because panicking at the sight of giant rats has a nontrivial chance of being *immediately* fatal, due to an ambush by giant rats right at the entrance, where running away at top speed could result in a fatal fall.
