The first possible character hook addressed is, well, none at all. This is a callback to [Ye Olden Dayes](https://allthetropes.fandom.com/wiki/Ye_Olde_Butcherede_Englishe), when games didn't have "stories".

Pac-Man, in May 1980, didn't even have an [Excuse Plot]; you just ran around a dungeon, dodging (and occasionally killing) monsters while stealing their gold coins. (Well, they might or might not be gold coins, but work with the metaphor here.)

And early D&D was like that.

In 1980, Advanced Dungeons & Dragons First Edition was in full swing, and the Deities & Demigods supplement came out. But not that long earlier it was basically an elaborate game of chess, specifically the Chainmail game from 1971. And Original Dungeons & Dragons, before AD&D, revolved around dodging monsters, getting shinies, and occasionally killing monsters.

The first step after that is the [Excuse Plot]. This example was not the first, but perhaps gets the point across the best in two sentences: "Bad dudes have kidnapped the President. Are you a bad enough dude to rescue the President?!" (The President is then never mentioned again until the end of the game.)

Mario Brothers, from 1983, had an [Excuse Plot]: Bad ~~dudes~~ turtles have kidnapped the ~~President~~ Princess.

Now, there are a lot of questions you *could* ask there.

The game manual gives her name as "Toadstool", which sounds...somewhat *defensive*, considering she's the human ruler of a kingdom of mushroom people. This actually makes a lot of sense; Catherine the Great was born Sophie Friederike Auguste von Anhalt-Zerbst-Dornburg of Prussia, and changed her name to Yekaterina (our "Catherine") to sound less foreign to her Russian subjects.

The turtles seem to be going to a lot of trouble to keep seven particular mushroom people captive; are they the Princess's cabinet? Her Secretary of State? Secretary of Defense?

Is the Princess a fair and just ruler? Why does this foreign King want to kidnap the Princess, anyway? A lot of people might have wanted to kidnap Catherine the Great, some for good reasons, some for bad reasons. Does he want to conquer the Mushroom Kingdom outright, or is this a dispute over an outlying province? Is there an economic motivation?

All things being equal, it's better to *have* answers to these questions in case a player asks; but some players really are just there to play the game, like chess, and won't ask any of those questions. It does no harm to have some extraneous worldbuilding, precisely because a theoretically-complicated backdrop can function perfectly well as an [Excuse Plot] just by ignoring most of it. (It *does* do harm to have a too-complicated ongoing plot among the NPCs, but that's because it causes the DM's idea of what the story is "really about" to diverge from the players'.)

The second character hook of the Sunless Citadel functions perfectly well as an [Excuse Plot] if the players choose to treat it that way.

And what is the Sunless Citadel's [Excuse Plot]? "Bad <del>dudes</del> <span style="color:#000000;background-color:#000000;">goblins</span> have kidnapped <del>the President</del> my children!"
