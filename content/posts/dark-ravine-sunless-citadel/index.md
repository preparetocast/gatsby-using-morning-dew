> The Old Road passes to the east of a narrow ravine...The ravine runs for several miles in either direction, with an average depth and width of 30 feet. At the point where it most closely intersects the Old Road, it widens to 40 feet. It also plunges much deeper into the earth near the pillars described above.

It's things like this that [made me want to contrive a reason for the PCs to travel by night](/rumors-heard-in-oakhurst#no-reason-to-walk-old-road-by-night). The module keeps making reference to what happens if the PCs travel by night, but never says *why* anyone would ever do that.

What I really want to ask, though, is this: Can the PCs see the roof of the Citadel?

Torchlight won't reach that far. But look at the cutaway. At about...eleven o'clock, sunlight briefly streams in through the ravine to the roof of the Citadel. Sunless it ain't.

<div class="imageWrapper">

  <img class="overlayImage5" src="/ravineOrklordSunlight.png"></img>
</div>

Of course, there will be shadows cast by the pillars, but the pillars aren't a solid wall.

The further-inward portions of the roof where direct sunlight does not reach will still be in deep shadow.

> At the road's closest approach to the cleft, several broken pillars jut from the earth where the ravine widens and opens into something more akin to a deep, but narrow, canyon.

("darkness shrouded depths"? It's not nighttime! [Not unless we contrive a reason for the PCs to travel by night.](/rumors-heard-in-oakhurst#no-reason-to-walk-old-road-by-night))

Does it matter if the PCs can see the roof of the Citadel? Well...

> Ventilation: All keyed areas contain an adequate air supply, unless noted otherwise. The air is renewed from countless cracks leading to the upper open cavern and the surface, as well as many miniature tunnels leading to thriving Underdark ecologies. These cracks are individually too small for any but Fine creatures to navigate.
>
> --- <cite>The Sunless Citadel, page 7</cite>

We can assume all cracks are indirect enough that PCs won't see *light* coming out of the Citadel at night. But during the day, they might see *smoke*.

But what are the odds they'd happen to be cooking at eleven o'clock, right? Well...according to the text, some fires specifically happen to be burning whenever the PCs show up.

FoundryAtropos made a nice map showing the fires in Area 15 (south of center), Area 20 (center), Area 33 (north of center), Area 39 (dim, west of Area 33), and Area 41 (northwest corner). (Areas 16 and Areas 36 are depicted with their fires not currently lit on this map.)

[![fortress level](https://images-wixmp-ed30a86b8c4ca887773594c2.wixmp.com/intermediary/f/693d03bb-4135-4b0c-9098-d9f555863179/dcclon0-5494cd30-3521-44b8-a42f-04b78da1bd88.jpg)](https://www.deviantart.com/foundryatropos/art/Sunless-Citadel-Fortress-Level-746761212)

FoundryAtropos also added fires you can see in south-center and center-west, to illuminate the dragon statue and the cult leaders, respectively. Those both seem like good ideas.

If the PCs hang around until eleven o'clock, they'll likely see smoke coming from near the center of the Citadel, as well as slightly northwest of there. Not that they're likely to hang around until eleven o'clock, but they *can* make a semi-survey of the site if they choose to.

Smoke aside, they can certainly see the outline of the roof.

(This image originates from Stormkeep, though they might not want to be associated with my mutilated version.)

As for smoke...well, before we go to the trouble of mapping that, let's take a moment to consider whether we want to make any changes.

Darkvision didn't change between 3.0 and 3.5, but it did change *while The Sunless Citadel was being written*, and it shows.

That doesn't match the description of darkvision as it actually got published.

Darkvision wasn't the longest-running fight over Third Edition --- [that was initiative](https://dmdavid.com/tag/every-version-of-dd-has-initiative-but-no-rule-changed-as-much/) --- but the darkvision rules were still in flux while The Sunless Citadel was being written. Sean K. Reynolds, one of the authors of Into The Dragon's Lair (a 10th-level adventure that was also being written during the state of flux), tells us of how darkvision was planned to function like echolocation, so that initially Into The Dragon's Lair was written with accomodating details like "business signs are carved deeply into the stone so they can easily be read with darkvision." With the then-current version of darkvision, essentially echolocation, darkvision could not be used to read --- just as in the Sunless Citadel quote above.

A problem they ran into writing Into The Dragon's Lair was that if darkvision was echolocation, then creatures using darkvision would see right through fog or mist as if it wasn't there. Or rather, water droplets do interfere with sound waves but not as much as they interfere with light waves and AARRGH, this was exactly the kind of problem that was supposed to be solved by replacing infravision with echolocation in the first place.

## Darkvision

It's worth remembering that the obvious alternative to infravision was *nothing*. Dungeon denizens could have used light sources just like PCs. But light sources underground tend to be visible from a long way off. (Even around corners!) The raison d'etre of infravision was to *simplify bookkeeping*. If dungeon denizens have infravision, they don't need to carry around light sources everywhere they go.

But it's not supposed to be completely transformative, so it's limited in range. The idea is that they never need to *carry* light sources, since they can always see the ground in front of their feet just fine, but they still have a use for *fixed* light sources, such as security lights placed at high-value chokepoints for the same reason a modern home might have security lights. A light source in a fixed location is obviously much easier for the DM to keep track of than one being carried around, so we want to keep those as normal.

+ Denizens don't need to carry light sources just walking around.
+ Denizens still have a use for stationary light sources.
+ Range limit, so unless a light source is present, we only need to keep track of what *nearby* denizens can see.
+ Otherwise, we want to *not worry about it*.

> In 1974 came the D&D Original Set. There, the infravision spell first appeared. The original version of the spell allowed the user to "see infra-red light waves, thus enabling him to see in total darkness." (Of course, you still might not see in total darkness if there were no heat sources around.) The spell lasted for one day and had a range of 40-60 feet.

So what's the problem? Well, the trouble is that infrared vision is an actual thing. And it doesn't match the desired properties at all. Infrared vision doesn't have a range limit. Obviously. Light waves in the infrared spectrum don't just arbitrarily stop at sixty feet any more than light waves in the visual spectrum do.

There's an obvious appeal to infrared vision. Near infrared reflects off of objects much like the visible spectrum does. And infrared is abundant in total darkness --- at typical room temperatures, black-body radiation doesn't product any significant visible light, but it does produce infrared.

> Blackbody radiation has a characteristic, continuous frequency spectrum that experimentally depends only on the body's temperature. In fact, we can be much more precise:
>
> A body emits radiation at a given temperature and frequency exactly as well as it absorbs the same radiation.
>
> This statement was proved by Gustav Kirchhoff: the essential point is that if we instead suppose a particular body can absorb better than it emits, then in a room full of objects all at the same temperature, it will absorb radiation from the other bodies better than it radiates energy back to them. This means it will get hotter, and the rest of the room will grow colder, contradicting the second law of thermodynamics. Thus, a body must emit radiation exactly as well as it absorbs the same radiation at a given temperature and frequency in order to not violate the second law of thermodynamics.

Infrared vision performs interestingly *above*ground --- after sundown, different parts of the landscape cool down faster or slower, so objects that retain heat longer become sources of infrared light as the night wears on. But we don't care about that; the *point* of infravision was to have the properties we want *under*ground.

> deep caverns tend to have a uniformly cool temperature; Mammoth Cave, in central Kentucky, has an average temperature of 54 degrees F. that varies only slightly year-round. This coolness makes everything look the same, bland shade of gray to an infravision user, but there is plenty of hope here for diversity. More distant objects radiate less visible heat than closer ones, so distant objects are dimmer and darker.
>
> --- <cite>[Infravision & Your Fantasy Hero](https://www.pvv.ntnu.no/~leirbakk/rpg/adnd/society/adnd_society_infravision.html)</cite>

Underground, everything tends to be pretty much the same temperature. Roger Moore thinks that you could still tell distance, but while I'm not entirely sure what he means, I'm pretty sure he's wrong. Black-body radiation depends only on temperature; the density of any kind of radiation goes down with the square of the distance from the source, but the cross-sectional area *also* goes down with the square of the distance from the source, so distant objects would appear exactly as bright as nearby objects.

In fact, we have built infrared-sensitive sensors, so we do have some idea what snakes and the like would see with their infrared vision in uniform-temperature caves in total darkness: an undifferentiated soup, unless we add a source of infrared light. In fact, First Edition *did* realize that.

> Creatures with infravisual capability of unusual nature, such as those which see infravisually to 90', are actually emitting infrared radiation from their eyes and seeing what is within this visual range by receiving the reflected radiation. Such creatures can easily distinguish floor, ceiling, wall, and other areas, as well as furnishings within an area. The eyes of all such creatures will appear as very brightly glowing red when observed by any other creature with standard infravision. Most monsters inhabiting underground areas will have this form of infravision.
>
> --- <cite>1st Edition Dungeon Master Guide, page 59</cite>

That explains the limited range: any emitted radiation will go down with the square of the distance, so there will be a limited distance before it drops below the threshold you can differentiate.

Notice, however, that this already makes the "infrared light" handwave entirely pointless. If the creatures are emitting their own radiation, then that radiation could be anything. It could be ultraviolent; it could be sound waves. Calling it infrared just introduces a slew of odd, undesired ideas.

> a creature with 90 feet or 120 feet infravision is actually emitting infrared beams out to 180 feet or 240 feet, respectively. All infrared light going out from its eyes must be reflected back to its eyes to be seen, so in theory those eye beams should be detectable by infravision out to those doubled ranges (assuming those eye beams don't first encounter a surface that causes them to be reflected). Furthermore, near-infrared light reflects from most normal surfaces just like normal light. A monster with superior infravision "paints" everything it sees with powerful heat rays, just as if it were carrying a double-beam flashlight. Thus, a gnome wandering an abandoned mine tunnel might see the corridor ahead of her "light up" with faint infrared light if there was a duergar 240 feet ahead of her. Does infravision work underwater? Cool water will dampen out nearly all heat radiation, and warm water will obscure it.
>
> --- <cite>[Infravision & Your Fantasy Hero](https://www.pvv.ntnu.no/~leirbakk/rpg/adnd/society/adnd_society_infravision.html)</cite>

So the plan for Third Edition was to ditch infrared vision in favor of echolocation. But what about fog? Well...what *about* fog? Water droplets in the air do increase attenuation of sound.

> The absorption of sound in fogs was experimentally studied by many physicists, but most of this work is not suitable for a close comparison with the theory because no analysis of drop size was made. In 1940, however, Knudsen carried out absorption measurements in artificially produced fog using the reverberation chamber technique, and in this work the distribution in drop size was determined.

> For higher frequencies the calculated points lie below the observed values.
>
> --- <cite>[The Absorption of Sound in Suspensions and Emulsions. I. Water Fog in Air](https://authors.library.caltech.edu/9121/1/EPSjasa53.pdf)</cite>

The effect isn't significant enough to be worth tracking for normal frequency ranges of 85 to 255 Hertz. [Citation: talk to somebody in fog.] But fog interferes more at higher frequencies.

> most echolocating bats produce frequency modulated calls with peak frequencies (PF, frequency of maximum energy) between 20 and 60 kHz
>
> --- <cite>[Nature Scientific Reports](https://www.nature.com/articles/s41598-017-00959-2)</cite>

That's kilo with a k. The attenuation is higher at those frequencies. How much does this really matter? That's...hard to say. It does appear that bats Do Not Want fog, for reasons unknown.

> On windless evenings fog commonly forms in dense, sharply defined patches, especially in sheltered bays of ponds. As the evening progresses and the temperature falls, these patches may grow and coalesce, advancing over the pond but maintaining a sharp front at which visibility changes profoundly within a few metres. In such conditions insectivorous bats hunting over the water have been observed to turn back at the fog front as if at a solid wall, even though their hunting area may become severely restricted. This behaviour suggests that fog may have a direct effect on echo location.

> --- <cite>[Bats and Fog, Nature volume 229](https://www.nature.com/articles/229572b0)</cite>

You *can* have echolocation operating at much lower frequencies --- humans can learn to do it. But frequency matters. The most successful human echolocators are using frequencies at the absolute upper end of human hearing.

> Humans can learn to use acoustic echoes to detect and classify objects. Echolocators typically use tongue clicks to induce these echoes, and there is some evidence that higher spectral frequency content of an echolocator’s tongue click is associated with better echolocation performance. This may be explained by the intensity of the echoes. The current study tested experimentally if emissions with higher spectral frequencies lead to better performance for target detection. The peak spectral frequency of the emission was varied between 3.5 and 4.5 kHz. Participants performed better using emissions with higher spectral frequencies. The findings suggest that people who train to echolocate should be instructed to make emissions (e.g. mouth clicks) with higher spectral frequency content.
>
> --- <cite>[Human Echolocation for Target Detection Is More Accurate With Emissions Containing Higher Spectral Frequencies, and This Is Explained by Echo Intensity](https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC5968665/)</cite>

Echolocation can work at lower frequencies, but worse. Just how deeply do Sean K. Reynolds' goblins have to carve their signposts? And what other complications haven't we thought of yet?

What do creatures using echolocation see in fog? The answer is..."It's complicated." And the entire point of the switch from infrared to echolocation was to *not be complicated*.

> The 3E playtest version of darkvision worked more like echolocation, until I pointed out some problems to MC [presumably Monte Cook], JT [presumably Jonathan Tweet], and SW [presumably Skip Williams] (for example, you wouldn't be able to see fog or mist with darkvision, you wouldn't be able to read the writing in a book, and so on), and it was changed to "just like normal sight, but in shades of gray" in the final version that went to print.
> So if you've heard the "darkvision = echolocation" line, you probably heard it from a 3E playtester (or someone who heard it from them).
> BTW I like the "dwarf with searchlight helmet and B&W camera goggles" description, that's pretty accurate.
>
> --- <cite>Sean K. Reynolds</cite>

The fundamental idea here is "Explanations via analogies to the real world are very valuable, but only if the real-world thing actually has the properties we want. Arbitrary rules are expensive in terms of headspace, but only if they're complicated. The thing we want is extremely simple --- indeed the simplicity *is* what we want --- and the real-world thing doesn't match it, so just...declare that the fantasy world works the way we want it to."

This change happened quite late in development --- Into The Dragon's Lair had to be hastily re-written.

> this required rewriting some common details about the city, like changing the "business signs are carved deeply into the stone so they can easily be read with darkvision" stuff to "it's a painted sign."
>
> --- <cite>Sean K. Reynolds</cite>

You could even see a bit of this in the 3.0 Dungeon Master's Guide.

> Tordek looks around a lightless cavern. He sees the chamber as a shadowless scene in black and white, fading into an indistinct gray 60 feet away.
>
> --- <cite>3.0 Dungeon Master's Guide, page 74</cite>

The text described darkvision as fading into gray, but the picture right next to it depicted the background as black. Black was more appropriate to the "echolocation" version of darkvision, where sonic waves went out into the void and any reflections came back too weak to be detected.

And of course, The Sunless Citadel retained a nod to the "echolocation" version that was *just* subtle enough that the writers didn't catch it when skimming through to fix all references to darkvision:

> goblins don't need the fungi to see. Instead, they need it for fine detail work (such as reading)
>
> --- <cite>The Sunless Citadel, Area 40</cite>

The 5e update kept this:

> They need its light for close work, such as reading
>
> --- <cite>The Sunless Citadel 5e, Area 40</cite>

Of course, 5e makes darkvision only make total darkness count as dim light (5e darkvision turns dim light into bright light). This arbitrary rule is exactly twice as complicated as the 3e darkvision rule, but it does serve as an all-purpose handwave for why goblins would want light in any and all situations.

Anyway. Before we make a map showing the smoke, we should double-check whether we want smoke to be visible from each of these fires. We might also want to add some, as FoundryAtropos did.

With darkvision in play, there are four basic reasons to have a fire:

+ Cooking.
+ Warmth.
+ To see colors.
+ To see at a distance.

### Cooking

The fires in Areas 16, Area 33, and Areas 36 are cook-fires. But those would only be lit when they were cooking...right?

Well, it's complicated. They might prefer to keep the fire burning *all the time*. The thing people often don't appreciate is that while striking *sparks* is easy, building a sizable fire can be much harder depending on local conditions.

In particular, when battles are depicted, fires are sometimes portrayed as things that just kind of somehow happen without any apparent dragons. This is really something that comes up in visual media (movies and video games), not books and tabletop, but it's worth bringing up for the benefit of people coming to fantasy fiction primarily from movies and video games.

> Many objects will either still be inexplicably on fire (despite the rain implied by all the mud) or be smoking from some previous fire.
>
> Why is everything on fire!? Who lit it on fire? Have you ever tried to light a tree on fire? It's really hard!
>
> Photograph of the "Slaughter Pen" which saw fighting on July 2nd, **1863** (!) at the Battle of Gettysburg: despite the heavy fighting, the trees are intact (this position did not receive sustained *artillery* barrages). Nothing is on fire, nor does it appear to have ever been on fire.
>
> It is true that incendiary weapons (pots, arrows and javelins) existed, but these were almost exclusively for sieges or naval battles. Pre-gunpowder incendiary weapons were almost always impractical on an open battlefield (obligatory Greek fire caveat; we'll talk about that another day).
>
> If things are on fire, it should be because someone has deliberately set them on fire, which normally means not a battle, but agricultural devastation --- one of these armies is burning crops and villages. That might be an invader looking to deal economic damage, or a defender engaged in scorched earth defense.

> --- <cite>[The Battlefield After the Battle](https://acoup.blog/2019/10/18/collections-the-battlefield-after-the-battle/)</cite>

Once a fire gets big *enough*, it can spread on its own (depending on ambient temperature and wind), but going from sparks to a good-sized fire and be quite delicate. So how hard *is* it to build a fire?

We can ignore the effects of miscellaneous chemicals that can interfere with combustion. And we can mostly ignore the need for constant oxygen input (though it's worth noting that you'll usually need to blow gently on sparks after setting them to tinder, and the point of tinder is to shred fuel into narrow pieces so that it's thoroughly mixed with oxygen). What's relevant here is that you need to *give* heat before you can *get* heat.

> You've got to give of yourself 'fore you're worthy to receive
> --- <cite>Desert Pete</cite>

#### Ignition temperature

Water at a high elevation can be penned in by walls. If you get the water over the walls, it'll flow downhill, and you can extract energy from that downhill movement --- to turn a water mill, for example. But you have to provide some initial energy to get the water out of the local minimum where it's trapped.

Ignition temperature is the same basic idea, but for chemistry. Oxidation is a process of decay to a lower-energy state, releasing the excess energy as heat.

> C<sub>6</sub>H<sub>10</sub>O<sub>5</sub> + 6O<sub>2</sub> -> 6CO<sub>2</sub> + 5H<sub>2</sub>O

the carbon dioxide and water is a lower-energy state than the original fuel and oxygen, but to reach that state it needs enough energy to get over the initial hump. It needs a high enough temperature.

A chemist will tell you that leaving H<sub>2</sub>O in your solution chemically interferes with the combustion process. And that's certainly true, and important in the lab. But what's more immediately relevant to us is that the ignition temperature of pretty much anything you want to burn is going to be above the boiling point of water. Thus, if the fuel is damp, before you reach the ignition temperature, the water will escape as steam, and every molecule that escapes is leeching off your heat.

> It takes 100 calories to heat 1 gram of water from 0 C, the freezing point of water, to 100 C, the boiling point. However, 540 calories are required to convert that 1 gram of water at 100 C to 1 gram of water vapor at 100 C.
> --- <cite>[Latent Heat and Freezing and Boiling Points](https://www.e-education.psu.edu/earth111/node/841)</cite>

So you want to dry the fuel in advance, before you try to actually ignite it.

Fresh-cut "green" wood can have a moisture content of around 60 percent or more. As a rule of thumb, you want to get that down to 20 percent or so before actually getting the wood anywhere near your fire. [[Storing and Seasoning Firewood](https://www.bioadvanced.com/articles/storing-and-seasoning-firewood)]

Ancient people dried firewood the same way they dried everything else: with sunlight and wind.

How long does it take to properly age/season/cure firewood? A couple of days?

Try six months to *two years*.

Disclaimer: wood is way more complicated than that. Aging/seasoning/curing firewood also causes desirable chemical changes beyond removing moisture, which cannot be replaced by simply boiling off the water later. But the point is you either need to have well-prepared fuel *or* spend more time and effort starting the fire.

> As if all that cutting, bucking and splitting wasn't time consuming enough, now you also have to stack all that wood.
> For those whose time is more important (or they are just tired), the thought of not stacking the pieces at all comes to mind often, and why not?
> We all have seen those piles used by, perhaps, our close neighbors or other people. If the firewood wasn't properly dried, there's no way people would be leaving them in piles like that, right?
>
> Yes, firewood can indeed dry, season, or in short, *get ready for burning*, even if you throw it all randomly in a pile.
> BUT...it is going to take a lot longer for the wood to season this way.
> There's no way for the sun and wind to reach the wood nicely. Sure, the pieces that are actually exposed will dry the soonest, but forget about the same for the ones that are buried deep.
>
> At the end of the day, how well can a pile of wood dry in your instance has most to do with where you live. That's why it is such a controversial topic: you can ask the same question of different folks living in separate locations, and they're definitely going to give you a different answer.
> If it's one of them drier and hotter climates, leaving the wood to season in a pile shouldn't be an issue, but if you live in, for example, the Northeastern parts of the U.S., I suggest sticking to the classic stacks (even if your neighbor says the opposite).

> --- <cite>[Will Firewood Dry In a Pile?](https://forfirewood.com/will-firewood-dry-in-pile)</cite>

Stacked firewood is also vulnerable to theft; obviously, firewood is too heavy and low-value to be a target for professional thieves, but anything left outdoors for long periods is a target for simple opportunism.

This may give you some idea why someone might pay a copper piece for twenty pounds of firewood. Aged/seasoned/cured firewood is easier to burn and, as a bonus, lighter to carry.

Sunlight and wind are a tad hard to come by in the Sunless Citadel.

Of course, prior to the coming of Belak the Outcast, the Durbuluks had to get their firewood from outside anyway. Durbuluk lignatores may have gotten it simply by raiding, taking it from farms in the surrounding countryside.

[Remember that the Durbuluks should not be unknown in the area.](/sunless-citadel-character-hooks-rescue-mission#oakhurstians-know-durbuluks-in-citadel) The Durbuluks don't have enough military hegemony to demand the humans actually bring their goods to the Citadel, as a feudal baron could demand, nor do they dare to wander the countryside alone. But they are strong enough that the humans cannot effectively defend against the sudden appearance of a large raiding party, and the Citadel itself obstructs any reprisals.

Or they might burn wood that hasn't been properly aged/seasoned/cured. If you lack the climate, weather or time to dry your wood outdoors, then you can simply expose it to a lot more heat to make it ready for burning. But that will make the process of building the fire longer and more arduous.

Wood is actually even more complicated, but the net effect just increases the importance of gradually warming the wood to prepare it.

> The ignition temperature of wood is affected by how long it is exposed to heat.
>
> When the temperature of wood rises to 100 C, chemically unbound water begins to evaporate from it. Then at around 180 C the lignin, cellulose and hemicellulose in the wood begin to disintegrate. Wood usually ignites at 250 -- 300 C.
>
> After ignition, the wood begins to carbonise at a rate of 0.8 mm per minute. Fire progresses slowly in solid wood, as the layer of carbon created protects the wood, and slows down the increase in temperature of the wood's inner parts (and thus the progress of the fire). For example, at a distance of 15 mm from the carbonisation limit, the temperature of the wood is under 100 C.
>
> --- <cite>[Fire properties of wood](https://www.woodproducts.fi/content/wood-a-material-4)</cite>

This is common among flammable substances that burn slow enough to be useful as fuels: there's some vaporization step that requires energy input to release whatever chemical actually oxidizes. (That's *why* they're slow-burning enough to be suitable for fuel.) But this ultimately all boils down to the same idea of getting over an initial energy hump.

If fire is our only source of heat, how do we heat wood so that we can burn it? Obviously, with a smaller fire.

##### Tinder

"Tinder" usually just refers to fuel that has been shredded to maximize oxygen uptake: splinters, shredded plant fibers, anything. That's the tinder in the tinderbox. Char-cloth may be referred to as part of the tinder, but is often talked about separately.

Tinder is all about the interplay of size, shape, oxygen, temperature, and *speed* of oxidation. Tinder burns *fast*; that's the point.
Material with more surface area is in contact with more oxygen at any given moment, so it can oxidize *faster*, producing more heat more quickly.
Raising the temperature of something enough to get a fire started is a local matter. Raising the temperature of the entire fuel pile by a little is much less valuable than raising the temperature of one piece of fuel by a lot.
If a spark ignites one piece of tinder, raising its temperature enough to begin oxidation, then that piece of tinder will oxidize *quickly* relative to its size --- a piece of tinder with a lot of surface area relative to its size will heat *itself* to a very high temperature, and then can potentially heat things it touches to its own temperature.

> As the fire's heat increases and combustion is more robust, we add larger pieces of fuel. Tinder's success depends primarily on the minute size of individual combustible fibers (fuel) and their exposure to air.  You want enough air between fibers to allow for the oxygen demands of the combustion.  Lots of little fibers in a fluffy mass means each bit of combustible material is exposed to oxygen-rich air.  Think of fluffiness as an ideal relationship between surface area and proximity of each fiber to its neighboring fiber. You want exposure to air, but not so much distance between fibers that the heat dissipates before combustion spreads.  You also don't want flare-ups or explosions that exhaust the fuel immediately. This relationship between fuel size, the proximity between fibers and available oxygen is what allows your spark to grow into an ember, and ember to flame. You can see this in the choice of popular tinder such as cattail fluff or cottonwood down.

Many kinds of fungus make great tinder, so tinder, at least, is no problem underground. Just shred the fibers and use them loose. Tinder can be shredded on the spot (which makes the fire-building process more time-consuming) or pre-shredded and stored in a tinderbox for later use.

Charring is often used as a catch-all term for the pre-oxidation steps of burning organic matter, forming pyrophoric carbon which then oxidizes more readily. Pyrophoric is from Greek purophoros 'fire-bearing', from pur 'fire' + pherein 'to bear'. While charring certainly lowers the ignition temperature, the modern-day technical definition of pyrophoric is that it ignites *at or below room temperature*, and nothing you do to wood will make it do *that*.

Charcloth is exactly what it says on the tin. Charcloth is fibers woven into a thin sheet --- that is, cloth --- that has been charred, and is now used to char fuel in preparation for burning.

You can retrieve charred bits and pieces from the remains of a fire, but generally the idea was to have neat little pre-measured pieces, which meant spinning flax or wool and weaving it into cloth cut into, say, 2-inch squares. Of course, you then don't want your cloth to get burned up in the process of charring it, so cloth was placed in an oxygen-deprived environment, such as an actual tin, closed except for a small hole (to allow gasses to escape) before being placed in an existing fire. This could prepare a large batch of charcloth ahead of time. Charcloth was so flammable that if the tin were opened before being allowed to cool completely --- bringing a rush of oxygen to the still-hot charcloth --- the charcloth might spontaneously ignite. Fortunately, people don't usually like to handle hot metal containers anyway. Though more fragile than the parent cloth, charcloth is still sturdy enough for normal handling as whole pieces. (Otherwise there'd be no point cutting it into 2-inch squares.) [[Feeding the Spark](http://www.vikinganswerlady.com/fire.shtml)]

Spinning fibers and weaving cloth is hard work. One kind of tinder that seems appropriate for goblins is rotten wood, but it would be dried and charred well in advance of use, so it wouldn't appear obviously "rotten".

One form of tinder available in D&Dland is a magical plant called touchwood. Touchwood, despite the name, is a fungus, one of several introduced in Races of Stone. The fluffy interior of the fungus makes for excellent tinder. It is also a drying agent --- dried touchwood absorbs moisture very readily. It is also a styptic that will stop a wound from bleeding. Touchwood left to rot on its own will glow with faint luminescence.

Sorry, did I say touchwood was from Races of Stone? Whoopsie, my mistake. Touchwood is, in fact, from real-world Earth, one of many substances traditionally believed to be magical.

In particularly cold or wet environments, people had to get more creative than usual to find tinder that would ignite even more easily, such as touchwood. They also used additional treatments, such as soaking (or preferably boiling, using a previous fire) the charcloth or touchwood in aged urine. But many places didn't use and didn't need the more advanced techniques.

But none of these --- not tinder, not charcloth, not even urine-boiled touchwood --- will ignite at room temperature. [Citation: if it did, it would ignite and burn away before you ever got your hands on it.] They need an initial influx of heat.

Initial heat could come from the sun. Lacking clear glass to make convex lenses, people living in the frozen Northlands of Earth would sometimes make fire-starting magnifying "glasses" out of, no joke, meticulously carved clear *ice*. Of course, trying to start a fire this way presents all the obvious problems: the ambient temperature must be low enough for the ice not to melt in the sun, and the tinder must be exposed enough to the elements to catch the sunlight over a long period of time, without ambient *wind* ruining the fire. And the ice must be very, very clear, meaning water from a *spring*, filtered clean by the rocks, *not* sea ice. So...situational.

Initial heat could come from friction. This was the earliest method, using devices made of wood and rope of varying sophistication. These were quite labor-intensive.

Or we could use a pyrophoric --- pyrophoric in the modern technical sense that it will spontaneously ignite at room temperature.

But that's impossible, isn't it? Anything that would spontaneously ignite would...spontaneously ignite. Though there is some wiggle room since we don't have to entirely forget about friction heat; one good sharp stroke could kickstart the process without putting in all the labor required using wood and rope.

Unless...it were a solid material that normally oxidizes slowly. Again, tinder is all about surface area exposed to oxygen. If we had a big chunk of pyrophoric material, with relatively little surface area exposed to air --- possibly with some kind of coating --- and then we gouged it deeply enough to tear out a tiny splinter of material from the inside, that hadn't touched oxygen before...

A tiny splinter has a lot of surface area relative to its size. So a tiny splinter of pyrophoric material would oxidize very rapidly, quickly reaching a very high temperature, even before it landing. A teeny-tiny, flying sliver of material, hot enough to glow --- a *spark*.

The pyrophoric would have to be quite hard and brittle, so that gouging it would send a tiny splinter flying.

If we dumpster-dived through all the rulebooks and found a material with exactly the right properties, we could potentially "strike sparks" much faster and easier than sunlight or friction could light a fire. Something hard...that oxidizes at room temperature. Hmm. Think about it.

##### Steel

While you're thinking about it, we'll talk about something completely unrelated: steel.

Old-time grognards will remember when the "best" material for weapons and armor was *bronze*.

At the simplest level, you could have tools, axes and spear-heads of stone, which usually meant flint. It could work with any hard stone that experiences conchoidal fracturing, so that breaking the rock will spontaneously produce a sharp edge. Flint had the desired properties and was commonly found.

You could of course always carve weapons from appropriately-sized bones or horns, from appropriately-sized monstrous beasts.

Or you could go for top-tier bronze weapons and armor. For those, you needed copper and tin, both appropriately hard to find, and then they had to be combined by a master smith.

Iron weapons were an optional rule, relevant mainly in places where bronze weapons simply weren't available. Iron is *soft*; roughly speaking, the softer the metal, the thicker the edge of a blade has to be. A thin edge made of soft metal will *bend* on impact --- leaving a suddenly *very* dull weapon! So iron was a terrible metal for blades, plus it rusted over time.

But someone on the design team liked the iron idea, and so when the new edition rolled out, they included a rule for "steeling" iron.

These days it's conventional wisdom that steel is OP. And, well, it *is*, I don't deny that. But the real problem was toxic players.

The fundamental idea behind steeling was sound: you have the option to add carbon to iron. This makes the iron harder, but also more brittle. That allows a thinner edge that won't bend, but there's a cost: the edge can get *notched*, chipping away a tiny piece on a hard blow, and each notch becomes a weak point where sufficient force can break the *entire blade*.

Obsidian was very sharp and very brittle, and while people certainly used obsidian where it was available (still do, in fact), you wouldn't call obsidian OP, right? We can forgive the designers for figuring that since obsidian didn't take over the game, steel wouldn't either. Sure, steel could be forged into shapes that couldn't be made chipping away at obsidian, but how much difference could that make?

The main design problem was that the hardness table and the brittleness table were written separately. And the designers didn't pay quite enough attention to the *middle* range. Which is perfectly understandable. They paid the most attention to the lower end (pure iron) and the upper end (pig iron), and neither of *those* were broken. The designers figured if each end was fine, then the middle was also fine. The problem came when the munchkins started dumpster-diving through every obscure rule looking for broken combinations. As it turned out, if you steeled iron to between 0.6% and 1.25% carbon, it was hard, but not yet brittle enough to matter.

Which still wouldn't have been disastrous, except that rules-lawyers spun BS to make steeled iron far more impact-resistant than it was ever intended to be. See, there was a throwaway mention in one paragraph that steeled iron became "springy" and creating the new category of "elastic deformation" --- it bends, then bends back into its original shape. This was obviously only ever intended to be flavor. The writer thought it would be cute to keep the original idea that iron is soft, in a way that didn't make it nonviable for weapons. But the rules-lawyers argued that, even when the rules CLEARLY SAID that the metal's strength had been exceeded, the iron could just bend rather than break. Of course, that made steel into a broken super-metal that was better than bronze even for weapons and armor. Even cheaper medium-carbon steels (0.3% to 0.6% carbon) could perform about the same as bronze.

But even *that* wouldn't have mattered, because the designers thought ahead and included a safety valve. Two, in fact, both of which are kinds of oxidation.

First, steeling iron requires a lot of heat, meaning burning a lot of wood. The deforestation this entails acts as a roleplaying penalty. This also makes steel expensive, and that's a serious drawback because steel weapons and armor are very time-limited --- because *steeling makes iron rust faster*. This very elegant solution meant any problematic steel equipment wouldn't be around very long.

The real problems all came from toxic players. Murderhobos don't care about deforestation. And rules-lawyers dreamed up a surreal variety of BS ways to insist that the steeled iron wasn't *technically* in contact with oxygen. Or to put it another way, the real problem was timid DMs. If Gary Gygax had been around, he would have smacked down all the players with XP penalties for bad roleplaying, and that would have been the end of *that*. No *true* roleplayer used steel; only hack-n-slash rollplayers cared more about whether they died for their country or they made the other guy die for his country, than about staying true to character.

And of course, as with most such things, there's the element of metagaming as well --- the characters didn't know the rules, so *they* had no way to know that steel weapons caused more damage, nor to know that thinner edges were sharper in the first place. (Some weasels try to argue they could somehow figure it out by "observation", but these are no doubt the same weenie DMs who allow players to see their own damage rolls. Hit points are an entirely METAGAME concept, so there's no way the characters could have any idea how much damage a given attack caused. Check. MATE.)

The rules-lawyers weren't satisfied with using OP weapons; they also wanted them *cheaper*. They'd try to weasel out of the downsides of high-carbon steel by saying they'd make just the *edge* of the weapon out of high-carbon steel, and make the core out of lower-carbon steel (cheaper and more likely to bend rather than catastrophically break) or sometimes even just plain iron.

The rest is history, the usual story of power creep. After a while *everyone* was using steel, even when bronze was available. True roleplayers still used bronze weapons and armor, since no real person would ever choose ugly gray crap over the arms of their ancestors, but new players learned primarily from the steel-users and just treated it like it was *normal*.

It's a shameful history, and perhaps best forgotten. (From what I hear, these days the latest edition came out with some BS "chromium" handwave so that steel just officially lasts a long time without rusting, just skipping all the oxidation-preventing BS entirely.) But there is a particularly appalling coda to all this.

High-carbon steel oxidizes fast --- very fast. Of course, by the rules, any natural oxidation is an exothermic reaction. (Actually, any "spontaneous" chemical process must be exothermic, according to the Second Law of Thermodynamics, but that's a longer story about "spontaneous".)

Rules lawyers spent most of their time arguing various ways to weasel out of how fast high-carbon steel oxidizes. But when they wanted to light something on fire, they turned completely around and argued that since high-carbon steel oxidizes so fast, a tiny sliver of it should get hot enough to glow --- and hot enough to light things on fire. That is, they abused the very same oxidation rule they otherwise tried to weasel out of, which RAI was supposed to be a *downside*.

##### Iron Pyrite

Sorry, bit of a tangent there. As you might remember (though I doubt it), we were looking for a hard, brittle pyrophoric that would yield a tiny splinter that would oxidize rapidly.

The answer is...iron pyrite. "Pyrite" is from Greek puritēs 'of fire', from pur 'fire', and the reason why pyrite was called that is perhaps now obvious.

Iron pyrite, or iron (II) disulfide FeS<sub>2</sub>, will spontaneously oxidize on contact with humid air. So will pure iron, of course, but iron doesn't have the right combination of properties to *strike sparks*.

Hmm, unless you mix iron with some carbon. That makes iron an excellent material to strike sparks from.

> Iron by itself is relatively soft and tends to bend rather than chip under the stress of a hard blow on a piece of flint.

> The harder a piece of steel the smaller the pieces of iron broken from it will be when struck against a hard sharp object. As discussed earlier, smaller pieces of iron will spontaneously burn hotter due to their increased surface area.

High-carbon steel is the basis for starting fires with flint and steel. The steel was the special part, so they'd sometimes refer to the steel as a "fire striker" or "fire-steel". The flint was an afterthought: all that's necessary is to gouge out a sliver of fresh carbon steel to oxidize. Flint is simply the most convenient and common material, for the same reason flint was used for stone axes: flint is easy to find, hard, and experiences conchoidal fracturing, so that breaking the rock will spontaneously produce a sharp edge.

("Fire-steel" is a confusing term *now* because some people started calling ferrocerium rods "fire-steels". Ferrocerium was discovered in 1903 by Baron Carl Auer von Welsbach. Ferrocerium is really all about the cerium, a rare earth element with a low ignition temperature. von Welsbach just tried various alloys until he found one with good physical properties for gouging out splinters. 70% cerium and 30% iron worked. Later developments added lanthanum --- lanthanum is harder to ignite than cerium, but burns hotter than cerium, and can be ignited *by* the cerium. But the core concept is almost opposite to an actual fire-steel: iron and carbon are commonly available and all the work is in preparing them, whereas cerium and lanthanum are comparatively rare, 25th and 28th most abundant in Earth's crust, compared to iron's 4th. But what's worse is when ferrocerium items are called "flints", gouged by hard steel blades, which makes things very confusing by completely reversing how flint and steel originally worked.)

High-carbon steel was harder or easier to obtain at various points in economic development, but we can derive the economic development from the price: 1gp for a flint-and-steel kit. That's ten days of work for a common laborer. Notably expensive, but not out of reach.

A tribe living in tight quarters only really needs one fire-steel to support five fire-pits in five rooms. It might be denied to some if they displease the local rulers, but if at least one fire-steel is available, then it can be used to start multiple fires over the course of the day.

As a rule of thumb, if an item costs less than twenty times the *average* liquid wealth of a community, then *someone* in that community can probably get their hands on one. [Dungeon Master's Guide, page 137] The assumption is that some people will have more wealth than others, and most of that wealth won't be in the form of coins. Given that the Durbuluk's liquid wealth is 808.6 times the price of a flint-and-steel kit, it seems safe to say *someone* can get their hands on a fire-steel.



### Warmth

The fortress level is still fairly exposed to the elements through the gaping maw of the ravine, so season makes a difference. [Practically everyone is going to start this adventure in summer](,,/adventure-synopsis-sunless-citadel), so the fortress level is probably warmish.

It is worth noting that the *grove* level is probably closer to a uniform 52 Fahrenheit in all seasons. The grove level is linked to the fortress level, but only by a single vertical shaft, so since warm air *rises*, the grove level is unlikely to receive much warmth from the fortress level.

This has no *mechanical* effect, since we don't bother to "officially" track cold until it drops below 40 Fahrenheit, but PCs may notice the air get noticeably chillier when they descend.

But as far as the fortress level is concerned, the module never specifically mentions anyone using fire for warmth, and that's probably not the reason for the Area 20 bonfires, either.

### To see colors

Seeing colors is important for showing off wealth. Or rather, it's important for *other people* to see the colors of your stained-glass windows, or in this case, jade figurines.

### To see at a distance
