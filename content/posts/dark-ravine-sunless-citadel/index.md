> The Old Road passes to the east of a narrow ravine...The ravine runs for several miles in either direction, with an average depth and width of 30 feet. At the point where it most closely intersects the Old Road, it widens to 40 feet. It also plunges much deeper into the earth near the pillars described above.

It's things like this that [made me want to contrive a reason for the PCs to travel by night](/rumors-heard-in-oakhurst#no-reason-to-walk-old-road-by-night). The module keeps making reference to what happens if the PCs travel by night, but never says *why* anyone would ever do that.

What I really want to ask, though, is this: Can the PCs see the roof of the Citadel?

Torchlight won't reach that far. But look at the cutaway. At about...eleven o'clock, sunlight briefly streams in through the ravine to the roof of the Citadel. Sunless it ain't.

<div class="imageWrapper">

  <img class="overlayImage5" src="/ravineOrklordSunlight.png"></img>
</div>

Of course, there will be shadows cast by the pillars, but the pillars aren't a solid wall.

The further-inward portions of the roof where direct sunlight does not reach will still be in deep shadow.

> At the road's closest approach to the cleft, several broken pillars jut from the earth where the ravine widens and opens into something more akin to a deep, but narrow, canyon.

("darkness shrouded depths"? It's not nighttime! [Not unless we contrive a reason for the PCs to travel by night.](/rumors-heard-in-oakhurst#no-reason-to-walk-old-road-by-night))

Does it matter if the PCs can see the roof of the Citadel? Well...

> Ventilation: All keyed areas contain an adequate air supply, unless noted otherwise. The air is renewed from countless cracks leading to the upper open cavern and the surface, as well as many miniature tunnels leading to thriving Underdark ecologies. These cracks are individually too small for any but Fine creatures to navigate.
>
> --- <cite>The Sunless Citadel, page 7</cite>

We can assume all cracks are indirect enough that PCs won't see *light* coming out of the Citadel at night. But during the day, they might see *smoke*.

But what are the odds they'd happen to be cooking at eleven o'clock, right? Well...according to the text, some fires specifically happen to be burning whenever the PCs show up.

FoundryAtropos made a nice map showing the fires in Area 15 (south of center), Area 20 (center), Area 33 (north of center), Area 39 (dim, west of Area 33), and Area 41 (northwest corner). (Areas 16 and Areas 36 are depicted with their fires not currently lit on this map.)

[![fortress level](https://images-wixmp-ed30a86b8c4ca887773594c2.wixmp.com/intermediary/f/693d03bb-4135-4b0c-9098-d9f555863179/dcclon0-5494cd30-3521-44b8-a42f-04b78da1bd88.jpg)](https://www.deviantart.com/foundryatropos/art/Sunless-Citadel-Fortress-Level-746761212)

FoundryAtropos also added fires you can see in south-center and center-west, to illuminate the dragon statue and the cult leaders, respectively. Those both seem like good ideas.

If the PCs hang around until eleven o'clock, they'll likely see smoke coming from near the center of the Citadel, as well as slightly northwest of there. Not that they're likely to hang around until eleven o'clock, but they *can* make a semi-survey of the site if they choose to.

Smoke aside, they can certainly see the outline of the roof.

(This image originates from Stormkeep, though they might not want to be associated with my mutilated version.)

As for smoke...well, before we go to the trouble of mapping that, let's take a moment to consider whether we want to make any changes.

Darkvision didn't change between 3.0 and 3.5, but it did change *while The Sunless Citadel was being written*, and it shows.

>

That doesn't match the description of darkvision as it actually got published.

Darkvision wasn't the longest-running fight over Third Edition --- [that was initiative](https://dmdavid.com/tag/every-version-of-dd-has-initiative-but-no-rule-changed-as-much/) --- but the darkvision rules were still in flux while The Sunless Citadel was being written. Sean K. Reynolds, one of the authors of Into The Dragon's Lair (a 10th-level adventure that was also being written during the state of flux), tells us of how darkvision was planned to function like echolocation, so that initially Into The Dragon's Lair was written with accomodating details like "business signs are carved deeply into the stone so they can easily be read with darkvision." With the then-current version of darkvision, essentially echolocation, darkvision could not be used to read --- just as in the Sunless Citadel quote above.

A problem they ran into writing Into The Dragon's Lair was that if darkvision was echolocation, then creatures using darkvision would see right through fog or mist as if it wasn't there. Or rather, water droplets do interfere with sound waves but not as much as they interfere with light waves and AARRGH, this was exactly the kind of problem that was supposed to be solved by replacing infravision with echolocation in the first place.

## Darkvision

It's worth remembering that the obvious alternative to infravision was *nothing*. Dungeon denizens could have used light sources just like PCs. But light sources underground tend to be visible from a long way off. (Even around corners!) The raison d'etre of infravision was to *simplify bookkeeping*. If dungeon denizens have infravision, they don't need to carry around light sources everywhere they go.

But it's not supposed to be completely transformative, so it's limited in range. The idea is that they never need to *carry* light sources, since they can always see the ground in front of their feet just fine, but they still have a use for *fixed* light sources, such as security lights placed at high-value chokepoints for the same reason a modern home might have security lights. A light source in a fixed location is obviously much easier for the DM to keep track of than one being carried around, so we want to keep those as normal.

+ Denizens don't need to carry light sources just walking around.
+ Denizens still have a use for stationary light sources.
+ Range limit, so unless a light source is present, we only need to keep track of what *nearby* denizens can see.
+ Otherwise, we want to *not worry about it*.

> In 1974 came the D&D Original Set. There, the infravision spell first appeared. The original version of the spell allowed the user to "see infra-red light waves, thus enabling him to see in total darkness." (Of course, you still might not see in total darkness if there were no heat sources around.) The spell lasted for one day and had a range of 40-60 feet.

So what's the problem? Well, the trouble is that infrared vision is an actual thing. And it doesn't match the desired properties at all. Infrared vision doesn't have a range limit. Obviously. Light waves in the infrared spectrum don't just arbitrarily stop at sixty feet any more than light waves in the visual spectrum do.

There's an obvious appeal to infrared vision. Near infrared reflects off of objects much like the visible spectrum does. And infrared is abundant in total darkness --- at typical room temperatures, black-body radiation doesn't product any significant visible light, but it does produce infrared.

> Blackbody radiation has a characteristic, continuous frequency spectrum that experimentally depends only on the body's temperature. In fact, we can be much more precise:
>
> A body emits radiation at a given temperature and frequency exactly as well as it absorbs the same radiation.
>
> This statement was proved by Gustav Kirchhoff: the essential point is that if we instead suppose a particular body can absorb better than it emits, then in a room full of objects all at the same temperature, it will absorb radiation from the other bodies better than it radiates energy back to them. This means it will get hotter, and the rest of the room will grow colder, contradicting the second law of thermodynamics. Thus, a body must emit radiation exactly as well as it absorbs the same radiation at a given temperature and frequency in order to not violate the second law of thermodynamics.

Infrared vision performs interestingly *above*ground --- after sundown, different parts of the landscape cool down faster or slower, so objects that retain heat longer become sources of infrared light as the night wears on. But we don't care about that; the *point* of infravision was to have the properties we want *under*ground.

> deep caverns tend to have a uniformly cool temperature; Mammoth Cave, in central Kentucky, has an average temperature of 54 degrees F. that varies only slightly year-round. This coolness makes everything look the same, bland shade of gray to an infravision user, but there is plenty of hope here for diversity. More distant objects radiate less visible heat than closer ones, so distant objects are dimmer and darker.
>
> --- <cite>[Infravision & Your Fantasy Hero](https://www.pvv.ntnu.no/~leirbakk/rpg/adnd/society/adnd_society_infravision.html)</cite>

Underground, everything tends to be pretty much the same temperature. Roger Moore thinks that you could still tell distance, but while I'm not entirely sure what he means, I'm pretty sure he's wrong. Black-body radiation depends only on temperature; the density of any kind of radiation goes down with the square of the distance from the source, but the cross-sectional area *also* goes down with the square of the distance from the source, so distant objects would appear exactly as bright as nearby objects.

In fact, we have built infrared-sensitive sensors, so we do have some idea what snakes and the like would see with their infrared vision in uniform-temperature caves in total darkness: an undifferentiated soup, unless we add a source of infrared light. In fact, First Edition *did* realize that.

> Creatures with infravisual capability of unusual nature, such as those which see infravisually to 90', are actually emitting infrared radiation from their eyes and seeing what is within this visual range by receiving the reflected radiation. Such creatures can easily distinguish floor, ceiling, wall, and other areas, as well as furnishings within an area. The eyes of all such creatures will appear as very brightly glowing red when observed by any other creature with standard infravision. Most monsters inhabiting underground areas will have this form of infravision.
>
> --- <cite>1st Edition Dungeon Master Guide, page 59</cite>

That explains the limited range: any emitted radiation will go down with the square of the distance, so there will be a limited distance before it drops below the threshold you can differentiate.

Notice, however, that this already makes the "infrared light" handwave entirely pointless. If the creatures are emitting their own radiation, then that radiation could be anything. It could be ultraviolent; it could be sound waves. Calling it infrared just introduces a slew of odd, undesired ideas.

> a creature with 90 feet or 120 feet infravision is actually emitting infrared beams out to 180 feet or 240 feet, respectively. All infrared light going out from its eyes must be reflected back to its eyes to be seen, so in theory those eye beams should be detectable by infravision out to those doubled ranges (assuming those eye beams don't first encounter a surface that causes them to be reflected). Furthermore, near-infrared light reflects from most normal surfaces just like normal light. A monster with superior infravision "paints" everything it sees with powerful heat rays, just as if it were carrying a double-beam flashlight. Thus, a gnome wandering an abandoned mine tunnel might see the corridor ahead of her "light up" with faint infrared light if there was a duergar 240 feet ahead of her. Does infravision work underwater? Cool water will dampen out nearly all heat radiation, and warm water will obscure it.

So the plan for Third Edition was to ditch infrared vision in favor of echolocation. But what about fog? Well...what *about* fog? Water droplets in the air do increase attenuation of sound.

> The absorption of sound in fogs was experimentally studied by many physicists, but most of this work is not suitable for a close comparison with the theory because no analysis of drop size was made. In 1940, however, Knudsen carried out absorption measurements in artificially produced fog using the reverberation chamber technique, and in this work the distribution in drop size was determined.

>
> --- <cite>[The Absorption of Sound in Suspensions and Emulsions. I. Water Fog in Air](https://authors.library.caltech.edu/9121/1/EPSjasa53.pdf)</cite>

The effect isn't significant enough to be worth tracking for normal frequency ranges of 85 to 255 Hertz. [Citation: talk to somebody in fog.] But fog interferes more at higher frequencies.

>
> --- <cite>[Nature Scientific Reports](https://www.nature.com/articles/s41598-017-00959-2)</cite>

That's kilo with a k. The attenuation is higher at those frequencies. How much does this really matter? That's...hard to say. It does appear that bats Do Not Want fog, for reasons unknown.

> On windless evenings fog commonly forms in dense, sharply defined patches, especially in sheltered bays of ponds. As the evening progresses and the temperature falls, these patches may grow and coalesce, advancing over the pond but maintaining a sharp front at which visibility changes profoundly within a few metres. In such conditions insectivorous bats hunting over the water have been observed to turn back at the fog front as if at a solid wall, even though their hunting area may become severely restricted. This behaviour suggests that fog may have a direct effect on echo location.

You *can* have echolocation operating at much lower frequencies --- humans can learn to do it. But frequency matters. The most successful human echolocators are using frequencies at the absolute upper end of human hearing.

> Humans can learn to use acoustic echoes to detect and classify objects. Echolocators typically use tongue clicks to induce these echoes, and there is some evidence that higher spectral frequency content of an echolocator’s tongue click is associated with better echolocation performance. This may be explained by the intensity of the echoes. The current study tested experimentally if emissions with higher spectral frequencies lead to better performance for target detection. The peak spectral frequency of the emission was varied between 3.5 and 4.5 kHz. Participants performed better using emissions with higher spectral frequencies. The findings suggest that people who train to echolocate should be instructed to make emissions (e.g. mouth clicks) with higher spectral frequency content.

> --- <cite>[Human Echolocation for Target Detection Is More Accurate With Emissions Containing Higher Spectral Frequencies, and This Is Explained by Echo Intensity](https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC5968665/)</cite>

Echolocation can work at lower frequencies, but worse. Just how deeply do Sean K. Reynolds' goblins have to carve their signposts? And what other complications haven't we thought of yet?

What do creatures using echolocation see in fog? The answer is..."It's complicated." And the entire point of the switch from infrared to echolocation was to *not be complicated*.

> The 3E playtest version of darkvision worked more like echolocation, until I pointed out some problems to MC [presumably Monte Cook], JT [presumably Jonathan Tweet], and SW [presumably Skip Williams] (for example, you wouldn't be able to see fog or mist with darkvision, you wouldn't be able to read the writing in a book, and so on), and it was changed to "just like normal sight, but in shades of gray" in the final version that went to print.
> So if you've heard the "darkvision = echolocation" line, you probably heard it from a 3E playtester (or someone who heard it from them).
> BTW I like the "dwarf with searchlight helmet and B&W camera goggles" description, that's pretty accurate.
>
> --- <cite>Sean K. Reynolds</cite>

The fundamental idea here is "Explanations via analogies to the real world are very valuable, but only if the real-world thing actually has the properties we want. Arbitrary rules are expensive in terms of headspace, but only if they're complicated. The thing we want is extremely simple --- indeed the simplicity *is* what we want --- and the real-world thing doesn't match it, so just...declare that the fantasy world works the way we want it to."

This change happened quite late in development --- Into The Dragon's Lair had to be hastily re-written.

> this required rewriting some common details about the city, like changing the "business signs are carved deeply into the stone so they can easily be read with darkvision" stuff to "it's a painted sign."

> --- <cite>Sean K. Reynolds</cite>

You could even see a bit of this in the 3.0 Dungeon Master's Guide.

> Tordek looks around a lightless cavern. He sees the chamber as a shadowless scene in black and white, fading into an indistinct gray 60 feet away.
>
> --- <cite>3.0 Dungeon Master's Guide, page 74</cite>

The text described darkvision as fading into gray, but the picture right next to it depicted the background as black. Black was more appropriate to the "echolocation" version of darkvision, where sonic waves went out into the void and any reflections came back too weak to be detected.

And of course, The Sunless Citadel retained a nod to the "echolocation" version that was *just* subtle enough that the writers didn't catch it when skimming through to fix all references to darkvision:

> goblins don't need the fungi to see. Instead, they need it for fine detail work (such as reading)
>
> --- <cite>The Sunless Citadel, Area 40</cite>

The 5e update kept this:

> They need its light for close work, such as reading
>
> --- <cite>The Sunless Citadel 5e, Area 40</cite>

Of course, 5e makes darkvision only make total darkness count as dim light (5e darkvision turns dim light into bright light). This arbitrary rule is exactly twice as complicated as the 3e darkvision rule, but it does serve as an all-purpose handwave for why goblins would want light in any and all situations.

Anyway. Before we make a map showing the smoke, we should double-check whether we want smoke to be visible from each of these fires. We might also want to add some, as FoundryAtropos did.

With darkvision in play, there are four basic reasons to have a fire:

+ Cooking.
+ Warmth.
+ To see colors.
+ To see at a distance.

### Cooking

The fires in Areas 16, Area 33, and Areas 36 are cook-fires. But those would only be lit when they were cooking...right?



### Warmth

The fortress level is still fairly exposed to the elements through the gaping maw of the ravine, so season makes a difference. [Practically everyone is going to start this adventure in summer](,,/adventure-synopsis-sunless-citadel), so the fortress level is probably warmish.

It is worth noting that the *grove* level is probably closer to a uniform 52 Fahrenheit in all seasons. The grove level is linked to the fortress level, but only by a single vertical shaft, so since warm air *rises*, the grove level is unlikely to receive much warmth from the fortress level.

This has no *mechanical* effect, since we don't bother to "officially" track cold until it drops below 40 Fahrenheit, but PCs may notice the air get noticeably chillier when they descend.

But as far as the fortress level is concerned, the module never specifically mentions anyone using fire for warmth, and that's probably not the reason for the Area 20 bonfires, either.

### To see colors

Seeing colors is important for showing off wealth. Or rather, it's important for *other people* to see the colors of your stained-glass windows, or in this case, jade figurines.

### To see at a distance
