> The Old Road passes to the east of a narrow ravine...The ravine runs for several miles in either direction, with an average depth and width of 30 feet. At the point where it most closely intersects the Old Road, it widens to 40 feet. It also plunges much deeper into the earth near the pillars described above.

It's things like this that [made me want to contrive a reason for the PCs to travel by night](/rumors-heard-in-oakhurst#no-reason-to-walk-old-road-by-night). The module keeps making reference to what happens if the PCs travel by night, but never says *why* anyone would ever do that.

What I really want to ask, though, is this: Can the PCs see the roof of the Citadel?

Torchlight won't reach that far. But look at the cutaway. At about...eleven o'clock, sunlight briefly streams in through the ravine to the roof of the Citadel. Sunless it ain't.

Of course, there will be shadows cast by the pillars, but the pillars aren't a solid wall.
